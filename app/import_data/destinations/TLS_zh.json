The former capital of the Languedoc, today the pearl of the Occitanie region, Toulouse has shone in France for a very long time. The voice of history still rings out on every street corner: the 'pink city', thus named because of the colour of the specific clay brick of the region, displays the struggles of history and time.<br />\nThe golden age of the city, between the 12<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> centuries, gave it its finest convents, like the Cordeliers and the Jacobins. Lovers of art and architecture will enjoy strolling around the Place du Capitole, built according to the classical canons of the 17<sup>th</sup> century, and through the streets of this city of shimmering colours.<br />\nThe character of Toulouse also comes from its emblems, which have made it famous throughout France. Its rugby team, Stade Toulousain, has conquered the world of rugby, and its gastronomy is hearty and delicious. For Epicureans, Toulousain <em>cassoulet </em>remains a highlight of every holiday. Try its local variations, from Toulouse, Castelnaudary or Carcassonne. In addition, its vineyards produce some of the best under-rated treasures of France.<br />\nFrom the Garonne to the Mediterranean, the Canal du Midi, an exceptional work of 17<sup>th-</sup>century engineering, offers the charms, surprises and leisurely pace of the inland waterways. Finally, about an hour from Toulouse near the regional Causses du Quercy park, you will have the opportunity to spend a night in the trees, close to the stars. Between gastronomic delights, historical strolls, and excursions to the surrounding countryside, enjoying the good life in Toulouse is assured.</span></p>","paragraph":[{"title":"","text":""}],"slideShow":{"topic":"","title":"","pictures":[{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-TLS-2","imageAccessibility":"Toulouse 2"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-TLS-3","imageAccessibility":"Toulouse 3"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-TLS-4","imageAccessibility":"Toulouse 4"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-TLS-5","imageAccessibility":"Toulouse 5"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-TLS-6","imageAccessibility":"Toulouse 6"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-TLS-7","imageAccessibility":"Toulouse 7"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-TLS-8","imageAccessibility":"Toulouse 8"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-TLS-9","imageAccessibility":"Toulouse 9"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-TLS-10","imageAccessibility":"Toulouse 10"}]},"mainVideo":{"videoTitle":"","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"152540542","sizes":[{"height":"360","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/152540542.sd.mp4?s=0c39039f3cc41893ba78bac840ad537077709fca&profile_id=112&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"720","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/152540542.hd.mp4?s=19c5d275a7b1bf1f626928f83ffd51adf0139d2c&profile_id=113&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"1080","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/152540542.hd.mp4?s=19c5d275a7b1bf1f626928f83ffd51adf0139d2c&profile_id=119&oauth2_token_id=911185232"}],"videoSource":"VIMEO","videoTopic":"","videoAccessibility":""},"otherVideos":[{"videoTitle":"Discover Toulouse and surroundings","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"rFf5r6xxV98","sizes":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rFf5r6xxV98?loop=0&rel=0"}],"videoSource":"YOUTUBE","videoTopic":"Insight video","videoAccessibility":"","videoImageUrl":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/TLS/video/TLS-video-1_1-1024x1024.jpg"}],"map":{"introduction":"","mapTitle":"Our selection of must-see places in and around Toulouse","mapId":"https://api.getwemap.com/customers/tbaf/points?destination=TLS&language=en&market=FR","mapUrl":"https://objects.airfrance.com/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/TLS/map/TLS-map.jpeg","mapTopic":"Discovery map","mapSource":"0","mapAccessibility":""},"seoData":{"seoTitle":"Toulouse: the pink city of a thousand flavours -
