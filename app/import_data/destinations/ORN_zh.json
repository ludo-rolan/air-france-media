Local celebrities such as Yves Saint Laurent or Albert Camus endorsed its lifestyle.</em></p>\n<p>Everyone who has been there knows that Oran is one of Algeria's most beautiful cities. Modern yet attached to its past, the country's second city after Algiers proudly boasts sumptuous monuments, radiant places and most of all, a view onto the Mediterranean beyond compare. El-Bahia “the radiant” holds a never-ending facade onto the sea, that offers freedom and colour-enamoured tourists a wide array of beaches, each more beautiful than the others. And most are accessible to the public...</p>\n<p>The word Oran, “Wahran” in Arabic, means “two lions”, those last two having been hunted on the Djebel Kar mountain near Oran. Two statues guard City Hall, and remind people of the episode. According to the legend, wild animals still lived in the area centuries ago. And just like lions approaching close to the suburbs, Oran was subjected to invasions over centuries. Open and cosmopolitan, the city fed on this mingling of cultures.</p>\n<p>Of Andalusian, Ottoman and French descent, the city also held an important Jewish community until 1962, when Algeria became independent. Nowadays, even though the Great Synagogue of Oran has become the Abdallah Ibn Salam Mosque, traces of Sephardic culture are to be found a little bit everywhere, especially regarding food (with meatballs, mouna – dome or crown-shaped brioche – and chorba – traditional soup – being choice examples).</p>\n<p>The myth of Oran is based on cafés, nightclubs, a relaxed way of life and a free spirit that the city never lost and is envied by many. In the past, people came to  listen to singer Reinette el Wahrania, and then to the gods of Raï music, which galvanized the youth, and helped forge its rebellion against authorities, a cultural rallying cry for the entire country. Oranese nights are at the very birth of Raï music. Today, other sounds have emerged from the heart of this ebullient city, ever as lively.</p>","paragraph":[{"title":"","text":""}],"slideShow":{"topic":"","title":"","pictures":[{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-ORN-2","imageAccessibility":"Oran 2"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-ORN-3","imageAccessibility":"Oran 3"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-ORN-4","imageAccessibility":"Oran 4"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-ORN-5","imageAccessibility":"Oran 5"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-ORN-6","imageAccessibility":"Oran 6"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-ORN-7","imageAccessibility":"Oran 7"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-ORN-8","imageAccessibility":"Oran 8"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-ORN-9","imageAccessibility":"Oran 9"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-ORN-10","imageAccessibility":"Oran 10"}]},"mainVideo":{"videoTitle":"","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"172557106","sizes":[{"height":"360","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/172557106.sd.mp4?s=4e5fa0825a5391a4f70b2dedd2aa8dfecc003839&profile_id=164&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"720","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/172557106.hd.mp4?s=14b897e6c4a0bc9bfd0d6341bd1883bd526ee7f7&profile_id=174&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"1080","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/172557106.hd.mp4?s=14b897e6c4a0bc9bfd0d6341bd1883bd526ee7f7&profile_id=119&oauth2_token_id=911185232"}],"videoSource":"VIMEO","videoTopic":"","videoAccessibility":""},"otherVideos":[{"videoTitle":"Discover Oran and surroundings","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"VZkraMMGeX4","sizes":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VZkraMMGeX4?loop=0&rel=0"}],"videoSource":"YOUTUBE","videoTopic":"Insight video","videoAccessibility":"","videoImageUrl":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/ORN/video/ORN-video-1_1-1024x1024.jpg"}],"map":{"introduction":"","mapTitle":"Our selection of must-see places in and around Oran","mapId":"https://api.getwemap.com/customers/tbaf/points?destination=ORN&language=en&market=FR","mapUrl":"https://objects.airfrance.com/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/ORN/map/ORN-map.jpeg","mapTopic":"Discovery map","mapSource":"0","mapAccessibility":""},"seoData":{"seoTitle":"Travel Guide Oran  - Plan your trip to Oran with Air France Travel Guide","seoDescription":"Stay in Oran: what to visit to Oran, where to stay, which restaurant to go?

With a combination of red velvet wall hangings, deep sofas and woodworks, Le Cintra develops a certain high-end spirit.<br />\nThe menu was once 100% Parisian, but has opened up to Mediterranean cuisine. Indulge in the sautéed veal with mash, foie gras, fish soups, grilled sea bass, and even salade niçoise, prepared according to the standards of the original recipe and served with anchovies!<br />\nIn this restaurant opened round-the-clock, excellent Algerian and Spanish wines are also available. However, the best times to enjoy the place are at lunchtime, or for early dinner, before going deeper into the night to discover another side of Oran.</p>\n<p><strong>Le Cintra</strong><br />\n14, boulevard de la Soummam<br />\n31000 Oran</p>\n<p>+213 560 00 03 46</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://fr-fr.facebook.com/Lecintraresto/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fr-fr.facebook.com/Lecintraresto/</a></p>\n<p>Menu: around 2,500 DZD</p>","moreInfo":[{"geoCoordinates":{"longitude":"0°38'44.772\"W","latitude":"35°42'15.166\"N"}}]}]}}],"articlesSort":{"ALL":["156615","143744","108301","81417","81418","81412","81419","81407","81405","81406","81421","81408","81413","81403","81410","81424","81409","81416","81415","81411","81423","81404","81414","81420","81422"],"RECENT_NEWS":[],"UNCATEGORIZED":[],"activity":["156615","108301","81412","81407","81405","81406","81408","81403","81410","81409","81411","81404"],"Gastronomy":["143744","81421","81424","81423","81420","81422"],"Hotel":["81417","81418","81419","81413","81416","81415","81414"]},"desktopSettings":{"initialNumber":5,"paginationNumber":10},"mobileSettings":{"initialNumber":15,"paginationNumber":20},"priceCurrency":{"code":"EUR","symbol":"&euro;"},"practicalInfos":{"origin":{"code":"ORN","label":"奥兰","canonicalName":"oran"},"destination":{"code":"PAR","label":"Paris"},"effectiveFlightDuration":"PT2H20M","spokenLanguages":[{"code":"ar","language":"阿拉伯语"},{"code":"fr","language":"法语"}],"time":{"jetLag":"+00:00","timeZone":"GMT+01:00"},"weather":{"pictogramLabel":"晴间多云","temperature":[{"value":15,"unit":"CELSIUS"}],"pictogramCode":"sunny_intervals","pictogramUrlSvg":"","pictogramUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/media/3646B953-6931-4D2F-97886B69A3CF7E33","description":"","content":{"cityName":"Oran","title":"CLIMATE AND WEATHER IN Oran","introduction":"Oran is a coastal city that enjoys a typically Mediterranean climate.
