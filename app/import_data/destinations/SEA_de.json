Its operation has remained traditional for over a century. You should therefore not hesitate to discover the immense variety of products offered. There, local farms sell their best cheeses and a wide range of high-quality fruits and vegetables, while fishmongers, who like to challenge themselves, put on a show by flying their biggest fish from one stand to another.<br />Opened in 1907, this immense public market remains an exception in the United States today, where very few similar places remain in the centres of large cities. Pike Place almost disappeared to make room for… a car park. Faced with the residents' discontentment, its demolition was soon cancelled in favour of large-scale modernisation.<br />Paradoxically, this is where the famous Starbucks Group was born in 1971! You can visit the first store of the brand that's now global. Of very modest size, it offered the best coffee on the market at the time, made according to traditional production methods.</p>\n<p><strong>Pike Place Market</strong><br />85 Pike Street<br />98101 Seattle</p>\n<p>+1 206 682 7453</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.pikeplacemarket.org\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.pikeplacemarket.org\" data-mce-selected=\"inline-boundary\" rel=\"noopener\">www.pikeplacemarket.org</a></p>","moreInfo":[{"geoCoordinates":{"longitude":"122°20'31.404\"W","latitude":"47°36'36.489\"N"}}]}]}},{"type":"POI","id":"135278","city":"SEA","country":"US","region":"AME","filters":[{"code":"MUST_SEE","label":"Must See"},{"code":"OUTTINGS","label":"Going out"}],"topic":"unexpected","publicationDate":"2018-03-23","isHidden":false,"isPartner":false,"isCrush":false,"content":{"title":"Seattle or the art of glass","introduction":{"small":"Discover Chihuly Garden and Glass and dive into an enchanting world to find impressive multi-coloured sculptures."},"mainPicture":{"url":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/news/SEA/seattle-ou-l-art-de-la-verrerie/SEA-seattle-ou-l-art-de-la-verrerie-1_1-1024x1024.jpg","accessibilityDescription":"Seattle or the art of glass"},"paragraphs":[{"text":"<p>Nestled in the middle of the Seattle Center, just a few steps away from the MoPOP and Space Needle, Chihuly Garden and Glass exhibits the remarkable works of Dale Chihuly, considered one of the greatest Native American artists in the country.

To take advantage of this magical place, you have to drive or take a ferry there. From the small town of Port Angeles, where ships load and unload tree trunks at sunrise, you will reach Olympic National Park through the northern entrance: Hurricane Ridge.<br />\nThere, in the hollow of the green valleys, stretches the largest area of virgin forest in all of the United States – some thousand-year-old trees measure up to 91 metres tall! Be sure to take a detour to Crescent Lake, formed nearly 7,000 years ago, reaching depths of 200 metres in some places! Alternately, explore the heart of the Hoh Rain Forest, the largest temperate rain forest in the world.
