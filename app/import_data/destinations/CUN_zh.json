This large seaside resort is famous for its beaches, crystal-clear waters, and sultry nights. Cancun has huge hotels, five golf courses, shopping centres, evening entertainment, amusement parks, nightclubs, and sports activities. If you are in search of quiet and authenticity, head for the Yucatan. In this region, the cradle of Mayan civilisation, you will learn about the country's history as well as discover heavenly beaches. Visit the Chichen Itza archaeological site and Coba pyramid, one of the few open to the public for climbing. Take a boat trip to Isla Mujeres to enjoy its Caribbean island atmosphere and traditional restaurants. If you have time, explore hidden Isla Holbox, where you can swim with hammerhead sharks and watch flamingos. Spend a few days in Tulum, where you can stay in boho-chic hotels, dine in trendy restaurants, and visit sublime ruins overlooking the Caribbean Sea. Take the time to dive into <em>cenotes</em> (gorgeous natural sinkholes, filled with azure waters), watch turtles lay their eggs at Akumal or get lost in the jungle of Palenque. If you dream of discovering Mexico from the Spanish era, go to Merida. In this very pretty colonial town, you'll love getting lost among its arenas, old buildings, and <em>haciendas</em>. Along your journey, taste fresh fish tacos, grilled fish over a wood fire with spicy sauces, shrimp nachos, and other traditional recipes. The Mayan Pyramids, sublime jungle, white sand beaches, and turquoise water is what makes the Yucatan the number one tourist destination in all of Latin America.</p>","paragraph":[{"title":"","text":""}],"slideShow":{"topic":"","title":"","pictures":[{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-CUN-2","imageAccessibility":"Cancun 2"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-CUN-3","imageAccessibility":"Cancun 3"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-CUN-4","imageAccessibility":"Cancun 4"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-CUN-5","imageAccessibility":"Cancun 5"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-CUN-6","imageAccessibility":"Cancun 6"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-CUN-7","imageAccessibility":"Cancun 7"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-CUN-8","imageAccessibility":"Cancun 8"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-CUN-9","imageAccessibility":"Cancun 9"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-CUN-10","imageAccessibility":"Cancun 10"}]},"mainVideo":{"videoTitle":"","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"152540548","sizes":[{"height":"360","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/152540548.sd.mp4?s=0c66dc5246578ae01626d3cf891b87750694a771&profile_id=112&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"720","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/152540548.hd.mp4?s=b0cdd36a2041ba3bfb59017102587ae42b75bf53&profile_id=113&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"1080","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/152540548.hd.mp4?s=b0cdd36a2041ba3bfb59017102587ae42b75bf53&profile_id=119&oauth2_token_id=911185232"}],"videoSource":"VIMEO","videoTopic":"","videoAccessibility":""},"otherVideos":[{"videoTitle":"Discover Cancun and surroundings","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"uexYFt2zIm8","sizes":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uexYFt2zIm8?loop=0&rel=0"}],"videoSource":"YOUTUBE","videoTopic":"Insight video","videoAccessibility":"","videoImageUrl":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/CUN/video/CUN-video-1_1-1024x1024.jpg"}],"map":{"introduction":"","mapTitle":"Our selection of must-see places in and around Cancun","mapId":"https://api.getwemap.com/customers/tbaf/points?destination=CUN&language=en&market=FR","mapUrl":"https://objects.airfrance.com/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/CUN/map/CUN-map.jpeg","mapTopic":"Discovery map","mapSource":"0","mapAccessibility":""},"seoData":{"seoTitle":"Cancun: the gateway to the Yucatán -
