All the better to wrap a rainbow around you like a scarf in its favourite &lsquo;joie de vivre' colours. </em> This poet of bad weather did indeed have a stormy youth. However, it has been many a storm since <em>Dubh Linn</em> has been the &lsquo;black pond' of its Gaelic etymology. Its bay, from the air, is like a dark blue eye. But Dublin has colour in its soul: the waves of green that sweep over St. Patrick's Day. And if Dublin were a beer, it would be as clever as a Jack-O'-Lantern which finds its colour even as it changes&hellip; In Dublin, life is gusty and windy, where the best stories worth their salt are tirelessly recounted... Derby on Sunday by the winter light! Parties and sparkling amber in the pubs, liquid holding-forths... Nosegays of fish and chips burning your fingers... And so many other excuses that allow you to have a good time in good company. When you are outside in Dublin, the best comfort comes from your friendly neighbour. When they go out, the people of Dublin, to paraphrase Joyce, carry in their soul a little warmth and comfort. They draw this special warmth from the purring fireplaces in their velvet parlours. And they will offer it to you with the disarming kindness that is so typical of them! For though the pints at your regular might seem destined for the giants that populate Irish folklore, in Dublin, everyone is welcome at the bar, if they can tell a story. As for Dublin's neighbourhoods, they revolve around three centres&mdash;the pub, the church, and the stadium&mdash;just like the three-leafed Irish shamrock. It's cold outside, but warm yourself in a crowd with a good laugh, the warm glow of a beer, and a fireplace: the Dublin routine awaits you!","paragraph":[{"title":"","text":""}],"slideShow":{"topic":"","title":"","pictures":[{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-DUB-2","imageAccessibility":"Dublin 2"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-DUB-3","imageAccessibility":"Dublin 3"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-DUB-4","imageAccessibility":"Dublin 4"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-DUB-5","imageAccessibility":"Dublin 5"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-DUB-6","imageAccessibility":"Dublin 6"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-DUB-7","imageAccessibility":"Dublin 7"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-DUB-8","imageAccessibility":"Dublin 8"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-DUB-9","imageAccessibility":"Dublin 9"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-DUB-10","imageAccessibility":"Dublin 10"}]},"mainVideo":{"videoTitle":"","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"152072929","sizes":[{"height":"360","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/152072929.sd.mp4?s=074427583e86ebfc28e0fc73012febc321e09487&profile_id=112&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"720","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/152072929.hd.mp4?s=7237c0cdfa96ac9acad6a4ee92d4588220498a44&profile_id=113&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"1080","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/152072929.hd.mp4?s=7237c0cdfa96ac9acad6a4ee92d4588220498a44&profile_id=119&oauth2_token_id=911185232"}],"videoSource":"VIMEO","videoTopic":"","videoAccessibility":""},"otherVideos":[{"videoTitle":"Discover Dublin and surroundings","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"lrx1xvT19lQ","sizes":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lrx1xvT19lQ?loop=0&rel=0"}],"videoSource":"YOUTUBE","videoTopic":"Insight video","videoAccessibility":"","videoImageUrl":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/DUB/video/DUB-video-1_1-1024x1024.jpg"}],"map":{"introduction":"","mapTitle":"Our selection of must-see places in and around Dublin","mapId":"https://api.getwemap.com/customers/tbaf/points?destination=DUB&language=en&market=FR","mapUrl":"https://objects.airfrance.com/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/DUB/map/DUB-map.jpeg","mapTopic":"Discovery map","mapSource":"0","mapAccessibility":""},"seoData":{"seoTitle":"Travel Guide Dublin  - Plan your trip to Dublin with Air France Travel Guide","seoDescription":"Stay in Dublin: what to visit to Dublin, where to stay, which restaurant to go?

You will discover, or rediscover, here, in a more private way, the life of the great prose writers of Irish history through a large collection of artefacts that belonged to them: various personal items such as James Joyce's piano, as well as confidential letters, portraits, and manuscripts, such as a first edition of <em>Dracula</em>. Visitors can't touch, but reading is highly recommended! Jonathan Swift, Oscar Wilde, Samuel Beckett… the exhibition dwells on each of these figures in chronological order, organised by literary movement. Constant recontextualising ensures continuity and the understanding of these authors and their works. Note that the museum has a small stage where you can enjoy, nourished by your newly acquired knowledge, eloquent and enchanting readings of the most beautiful, incantatory prose that Irish writers have created.</p>\n<p><strong>Dublin Writers Museum</strong><br />\nRotunda District<br />\n18-19 Parnell Square North<br />\nDublin 1</p>\n<p>+353 (0)1 872 2077</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.visitdublin.com/see-do/details/dublin-writers-museum#53.354366|-6.263985|16\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.visitdublin.com/see-do/details/dublin-writers-museum</a></p>","moreInfo":[{"geoCoordinates":{"longitude":"6°15'50.597\"W","latitude":"53°21'15.881\"N"}}]}]}},{"type":"POI","id":"3217","city":"DUB","country":"IE","region":"EUR","filters":[{"code":"ACCOMODATION","label":"Accommodation"}],"topic":"design","publicationDate":"2016-02-07","isHidden":false,"isPartner":false,"isCrush":false,"content":{"title":"Clontarf Castle Hotel: the most modern castle hotel in Ireland","introduction":{"small":"The Clontarf Castle is the successful marriage of the timeless charm of an Irish castle and the high standards of a modern palace hotel."},"mainPicture":{"url":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/news/DUB/clontarf-castle-hotel-le-chateau-hotel-le-plus-moderne-d-irlande/DUB-clontarf-castle-hotel-le-chateau-hotel-le-plus-moderne-d-irlande-1_1-1024x1024.jpg","accessibilityDescription":"Clontarf Castle Hotel: the most modern castle hotel in Ireland"},"paragraphs":[{"text":"<p>When you arrive, take the time to enjoy the majesty of the building, whose foundations date back to the 12<sup>th</sup> century.
