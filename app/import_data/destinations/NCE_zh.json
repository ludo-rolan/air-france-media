Real life is outside, found in a walk along 'The Prom', for its clarity and transparency. A way of life is at work in this city, which softens the sadness of existence. Time here seems to be denser and richer than elsewhere, like the light, which one feels could be drawn in with both hands, given how it flows in such abundance.
