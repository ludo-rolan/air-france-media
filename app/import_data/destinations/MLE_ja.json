On land or on stilts, the villas are built of wood and thatch and are one with the surrounding natural environment. Some even have their own private pool above the ocean. Explore the marine world - diving or snorkelling to see the fish and other corals - or take a boat to meet some dolphins: seeing them leaping from the water is something you will never cease to enjoy. At the end of your day, six restaurants and bars - the majority of which are on the beach - welcome you for a relaxing moment to the sound of the waves in the cool breeze.</p>\n<p><strong>Six Senses Laamu Hotel</strong><br />\nOlhuveli Island<br />\nLaamu Atoll<br />\nMaldives<br />\n+960 680 0800<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.sixsenses.com/resorts/laamu/destination\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.sixsenses.com/resorts/laamu/destination</a></p>\n<p>Room: from 12,680 MVR per night</p>","moreInfo":[{"geoCoordinates":{"longitude":"73°24'20.412\"E","latitude":"1°49'0.84\"N"}}]}]}},{"type":"POI","id":"108328","city":"MLE","country":"MV","region":"ASI","filters":[{"code":"MUST_SEE","label":"Must See"},{"code":"ARTS_AND_CULTURE","label":"Art and Culture"}],"topic":"art and culture exploration","publicationDate":"2017-07-11","isHidden":false,"isPartner":false,"isCrush":false,"content":{"title":"Malé, the Maldives' beating heart","introduction":{"small":"Malé reveals another side of the Maldives… in stark contrast with the pace of the rest of the archipelago."},"mainPicture":{"url":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/news/MLE/male-coeur-palpitant-des-maldives/MLE-male-coeur-palpitant-des-maldives-1_1-1024x1024.jpg","accessibilityDescription":"Malé, the Maldives' beating heart"},"paragraphs":[{"text":"<p>Before boarding your speed boat or taking off on a seaplane to reach your dream island-hotel, enjoy a visit to Malé and discover the most populated city of the Maldives.
