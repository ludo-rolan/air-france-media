And some of these restaurants manage to live up to their reputation. This is the case for Probka, serving Italian cuisine. Originally, its owner, Aram Mnatsakanov, imported wines from Italy and France. Now he runs a group of restaurants in Saint Petersburg and Moscow, all highly popular among locals and tourists. As for Probka, it is located on the ground floor of an office building, a few steps away from the Leningrad zoo, the <a href=\"../common/travel-guide/peter-and-paul-fortress-the-city-s-place-of-birth.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Peter and Paul Fortress</a> and the Neva river. The menu boasts eclectic selections like the oven-baked eggplant hummus, tuna tartare, seafood fritters with aioli, <em>taglioni</em> in squid ink and salmon caviar, as well as various salads, pizzas and risottos, all accompanied by excellent wines by the glass or bottle. The list has more than a hundred wines from around the world, to be enjoyed in moderation.

Card games, backgammon, and chess boards are available, laid out on the tables. But it is for the food itself that regulars come to The Idiot: Russian blinis with salmon and cucumber or fish eggs and whipping cream, herring with marinated onions and potatoes, borsch, Stroganoff beef with mushrooms… as well as good vegetarian fare.</p>\n<p>A small glass of vodka is offered to all comers, on the house. At the bar, try one of the famous cocktail specials, especially the well-named 'Crime and Punishment', one of the many specialities paying tribute to the creator of <em>The</em> <em>Brothers Karamazov.</em></p>\n<p><strong>The Idiot</strong><br />\nNaberezhnaya reki Moyki 82<br />\n190000 Sankt-Peterburg</p>\n<p>+7 812 946 5173</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://idiot-spb.com/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://idiot-spb.com/en</a></p>\n<p>Menu: around 1,800 RUB</p>","moreInfo":[{"geoCoordinates":{"longitude":"30°18'12.599\"E","latitude":"59°55'49.089\"N"}}]}]}}],"articlesSort":{"ALL":["202737","202687","202692","156342","156346","109922","4502","4446","4532","4479","4448","4576","4452","4488","4495","4511","4457","4477","4564","4469","4444","4507","4499","4521"],"RECENT_NEWS":[],"UNCATEGORIZED":[],"activity":["109922","4446","4479","4448","4452","4488","4495","4457","4477","4469","4444"],"Gastronomy":["202687","156342","4532","4576","4564","4521"],"Hotel":["202737","202692","156346","4502","4511","4507","4499"]},"desktopSettings":{"initialNumber":5,"paginationNumber":10},"mobileSettings":{"initialNumber":15,"paginationNumber":20},"priceCurrency":{"code":"EUR","symbol":"&euro;"},"practicalInfos":{"origin":{"code":"LED","label":"St. Petersburg","canonicalName":"st-petersburg"},"destination":{"code":"PAR","label":"Paris"},"effectiveFlightDuration":"PT3H20M","spokenLanguages":[{"code":"ru","language":"Russisch"}],"time":{"jetLag":"+02:00","timeZone":"GMT+03:00"},"weather":{"pictogramLabel":"weiße Wolken","temperature":[{"value":1,"unit":"CELSIUS"}],"pictogramCode":"white_cloud","pictogramUrlSvg":"","pictogramUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/media/566B2B45-FCBA-4F71-9BB65C78B6384C33","description":""},"currency":{"data":{"code":"RUB","label":"Russischer Rubel","rate":87,"symbol":"&#1088;"}},"travelGuide":{"isTravelGuideAvailable":false}}}
