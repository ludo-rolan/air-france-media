Perched on a block of granite, the Tanguy Tower, with its small museum, is among its most iconic remains.</p>\n<p>Further south, the Jardin des Explorateurs pays homage to some of the world's most important maritime expeditions. Steps away is the Maison de la Fontaine, one of the oldest houses in the city, dating from the 17<sup>th</sup> century. But to truly find the atmosphere of old Brest, push north to the picturesque rue Saint-Malo, with its ancient washhouse (<em>lavoir</em>), paving stones, and well-preserved houses.</p>\n<p><strong>Musée de la tour Tanguy (Tanguy Tower)</strong><br />\nSquare Pierre Péron<br />\n29200 Brest<br />\n+33 (0)2 98 00 80 80<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.brest.fr/culture/les-equipements-culturels/la-tour-tanguy-une-sentinelle-sur-la-penfeld-2126.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.brest.fr/culture/les-equipements-culturels/la-tour-tanguy-une-sentinelle-sur-la-penfeld-2126.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>Jardin des Explorateurs</strong><br />\n3 rue de la Pointe<br />\n29200 Brest<br />\n<u><a href=\"https://www.brest-metropole-tourisme.fr/sortir-bouger/loisirs/brest-nature-detente/le-jardin-des-explorateurs-10929\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.brest-metropole-tourisme.fr/sortir-bouger/loisirs/brest-nature-detente/le-jardin-des-explorateurs-10929</a></u></p>\n<p><strong>Maison de la Fontaine</strong><br />\n18 rue de l'Église<br />\n29200 Brest<br />\n+33 (0)2 98 05 45 89<br />\n<u><a href=\"https://www.brest.fr/culture/les-equipements-culturels/la-maison-de-la-fontaine-2128.html\">https://www.brest.fr/culture/les-equipements-culturels/la-maison-de-la-fontaine-2128.html</a></u></p>"}]}}],"articlesSort":{"ALL":["198949","198954","198940","155275","139963","107367","107369","107365","110491","78519","78511","78492","78498","78532","78508","78582","78524","78573","78504","78500","78547","78553","78502","78549","78515","78557","78541","78496","78554","78551","78539","78534","78561","78543","78571","78575","78578","78521","78537","78530","78513","78486","78580","78488","78517","78490","78545","78559","78494"],"RECENT_NEWS":[],"UNCATEGORIZED":["78561","78575"],"activity":["198940","107367","107369","110491","78519","78511","78492","78498","78532","78508","78524","78504","78500","78502","78515","78496","78521","78530","78513","78486","78488","78517","78490","78494"],"Gastronomy":["198954","155275","139963","78582","78573","78557","78554","78571","78578","78580","78559"],"Hotel":["198949","107365","78547","78553","78549","78541","78551","78539","78534","78543","78537","78545"]},"desktopSettings":{"initialNumber":5,"paginationNumber":10},"mobileSettings":{"initialNumber":15,"paginationNumber":20},"priceCurrency":{"code":"EUR","symbol":"&euro;"},"practicalInfos":{"origin":{"code":"BES","label":"Брест","canonicalName":"brest"},"destination":{"code":"PAR","label":"Париж"},"effectiveFlightDuration":"PT1H10M","spokenLanguages":[{"code":"fr","language":"French"}],"time":{"jetLag":"+00:00","timeZone":"GMT+01:00"},"weather":{"pictogramLabel":"белые облака","temperature":[{"value":8,"unit":"CELSIUS"}],"pictogramCode":"white_cloud","pictogramUrlSvg":"","pictogramUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/media/566B2B45-FCBA-4F71-9BB65C78B6384C33","description":""},"currency":{"data":{"code":"EUR","label":"Евро","rate":1,"symbol":"&#8364;"}},"travelGuide":{"isTravelGuideAvailable":false}}}
