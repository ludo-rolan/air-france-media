Recreational and sightseeing opportunities change with the seasons, which, in turn, reveal the charms and pleasures of a city of comfortable, human scale.</em></p>\n<p>‘With its large mirror-like lake and brilliant azure river, Geneva has two skies', wrote Jules Michelet in the 19<sup>th</sup>century. Geneva is a postcard-perfect town. It unfolds on both shores of Lake Geneva against a backdrop of pure greenery; in the distance sparkle the snow-capped peaks of the Alps, the most famous being Mont Blanc. Water is everywhere: in addition to the lake, two major rivers—the Rhône and the Arve—cross the city. In the summer, swimmers and strollers are out in full force, when the riversides are taken over by <em>guingettes, </em>traditional festive drinking gardens. Grand, well-maintained parks occupy 20% of Geneva, with 310 hectares of green space.</p>\n<p>Geneva's right bank is international. As the birthplace of the Red Cross and the headquarters for the United Nations, the city is an international capital of peace. The Right Bank also hosts over 200 international organisations. The Left Bank is where the largest luxury brands and banking institutions are.</p>\n<p>A cultural mecca, Geneva has some 30 museums, covering all fields of knowledge: the natural sciences, science and technology, the arts and world cultures, and literature. A visit to Geneva is to discover a great patron of the arts and sciences. Immerse yourself in centuries of history, from the Maison Tavel, the city's oldest building and home to the imposing Museum of History, which was among the first buildings to be built outside the walls of the upper city, to the Museum of Ethnography, which has just beenexpanded.</p>\n<p>Geneva, ‘the smallest of the great capitals', has another major advantage: the peaks that serve as backdrop to Lake Geneva are no illusion. You can get to ski slopes in France in 45 minutes, in Italy and Switzerland in two hours. In addition, Geneva is a wonderful place to see the changing seasons. In the fall, the surrounding vineyards adorn themselves with their most beautiful colours. In spring, the Geneva vineyards, which extend over 1400 hectares, hold their famous ‘Open Cellars' festival. As Geneva exports only1-2% of its wines, if you want to taste the local vintages,you have to make the trip.</p>","paragraph":[{"title":"","text":""}],"slideShow":{"topic":"","title":"","pictures":[{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-GVA-2","imageAccessibility":"Geneva 2"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-GVA-3","imageAccessibility":"Geneva 3"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-GVA-4","imageAccessibility":"Geneva 4"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-GVA-5","imageAccessibility":"Geneva 5"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-GVA-6","imageAccessibility":"Geneva 6"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-GVA-7","imageAccessibility":"Geneva 7"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-GVA-8","imageAccessibility":"Geneva 8"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-GVA-9","imageAccessibility":"Geneva 9"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-GVA-10","imageAccessibility":"Geneva 10"}]},"mainVideo":{"videoTitle":"","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"152540557","sizes":[{"height":"360","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/152540557.sd.mp4?s=748291a41590c325fe1a1941c6a533b43db1fd46&profile_id=112&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"720","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/152540557.hd.mp4?s=48325948cb11128911fcfac69d2d5ab0dea2398b&profile_id=113&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"1080","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/152540557.hd.mp4?s=48325948cb11128911fcfac69d2d5ab0dea2398b&profile_id=119&oauth2_token_id=911185232"}],"videoSource":"VIMEO","videoTopic":"","videoAccessibility":""},"otherVideos":[{"videoTitle":"Discover Geneva and surroundings","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"jjfNyMmRs-o","sizes":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jjfNyMmRs-o?loop=0&rel=0"}],"videoSource":"YOUTUBE","videoTopic":"Insight video","videoAccessibility":"","videoImageUrl":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/GVA/video/GVA-video-1_1-1024x1024.jpg"}],"map":{"introduction":"","mapTitle":"Our selection of must-see places in and around Geneva","mapId":"https://api.getwemap.com/customers/tbaf/points?destination=GVA&language=en&market=FR","mapUrl":"https://objects.airfrance.com/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/GVA/map/GVA-map.jpeg","mapTopic":"Discovery map","mapSource":"0","mapAccessibility":""},"seoData":{"seoTitle":"Travel Guide Geneva  - Plan your trip to Geneva with Air France Travel Guide","seoDescription":"Stay in Geneva: what to visit to Geneva, where to stay, which restaurant to go?

It was the first-ever intergovernmental organisation with a political vocation to be established at the heart of world diplomacy.</p>\n<p>The need to build a ‘temple of peace' quickly became obvious. Several architects Carlo Broggi (Italy), Julien Flegenheimer (Switzerland), Camille Lefèvre and Henri-Paul Nénot (France), and Joseph Vago (Hungary) worked together on the project. The construction lasted from 1929 to 1937 and was the largest architectural project of its time in Europe. The building it gave birth to is as large as Versailles. The exterior of the complex, consisting of five buildings, is characterised by monumental Academicism; its interior, however, is decorated with outstanding works of art, reflecting the cultural diversity of the countries that made up the League.</p>\n<p>The League of Nations stopped its activities with the Second World War. After its dissolution in 1946, the Palace became the European headquarters of the United Nations and, in 1966, the United Nations Office at Geneva (UNOG).
