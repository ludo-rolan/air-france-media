In </em><em>Molière's country, even if you do not speak the language, your nose can appreciate its multitude of scents.</em></p>\n<p>Paris has been described as the joy of living in a myriad of little things: the scent of a cup of coffee and croissants in the morning, elegant women in grey suits smiling in the streets, the smell of hot bread, the enticing aromas in the food markets, the bouquet of a bottle of wine shared with friends, the trail of mythic perfumes wafting over the doorsill of luxury boutiques, the incense in houses of worship in a country that believes only in life.</p>\n<p>Paris is the mingled scent of books and bouquets of flowers and the baked goodness of children's afternoon snacks in the city's magnificent public gardens. The exquisite chocolate, spicy scents of the latest pastry shops, and the savoury deliciousness of Michelin-starred restaurants and impromptu picnics in park squares. It is the mineral fragrance that wells up in the foyers of Haussmannian buildings, the alcoves of palace hotels, and its boutique hotels. Always, Paris is the odour of the city's wooden school benches, and the lighter, cheerier scents of its working-class neighbourhoods.</p>\n<p>Here in the most visited and celebrated city in the world, you need not  concern yourself  with life after death – After all, the Père-Lachaise cemetery is the largest park in the city. Paris has always known how to live and laugh. The only thing you no longer find is that nostalgic scent of dusty museums, which have all been renovated.</p>","paragraph":[{"title":"","text":""}],"slideShow":{"topic":"","title":"","pictures":[{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-PAR-2","imageAccessibility":"Paris 2"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-PAR-3","imageAccessibility":"Paris 3"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-PAR-4","imageAccessibility":"Paris 4"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-PAR-5","imageAccessibility":"Paris 5"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-PAR-6","imageAccessibility":"Paris 6"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-PAR-7","imageAccessibility":"Paris 7"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-PAR-8","imageAccessibility":"Paris 8"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-PAR-9","imageAccessibility":"Paris 9"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-PAR-10","imageAccessibility":"Paris 10"}]},"mainVideo":{"videoTitle":"","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"149260032","sizes":[{"height":"360","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/149260032.sd.mp4?s=779bae092251bf289c6a23d6c3d29c2184bd6c71&profile_id=112&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"720","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/149260032.hd.mp4?s=856d3ff68c726fd3c670b4517b940866340d4561&profile_id=113&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"1080","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/149260032.hd.mp4?s=856d3ff68c726fd3c670b4517b940866340d4561&profile_id=119&oauth2_token_id=911185232"}],"videoSource":"VIMEO","videoTopic":"","videoAccessibility":""},"otherVideos":[{"videoTitle":"Discover Paris and surroundings","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"dw1tKAtwhhk","sizes":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dw1tKAtwhhk?loop=0&rel=0"}],"videoSource":"YOUTUBE","videoTopic":"Insight video","videoAccessibility":"","videoImageUrl":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/PAR/video/PAR-video-1_1-1024x1024.jpg"}],"map":{"introduction":"","mapTitle":"Our selection of must-see places in and around Paris","mapId":"https://api.getwemap.com/customers/tbaf/points?destination=PAR&language=en&market=FR","mapUrl":"https://objects.airfrance.com/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/PAR/map/PAR-map.jpeg","mapTopic":"Discovery map","mapSource":"0","mapAccessibility":""},"seoData":{"seoTitle":"The scent of Paris – Paris Travel Guide","seoDescription":"As you walk around Paris's many neighbourhoods, let yourself be led by your nose.

Your guide recounts the turbulent history of this palace, then lingers on the grand staircase, a favourite haunt of Paris high society in the late 19<sup>th</sup>-century. Blown away by the size of the nave and the materials used for this grandiose décor, you finally discover the “grand foyer”, a long bright room inspired by the Versailles Hall of Mirrors. Tall picture windows look out from this sumptuous location over the avenue de l'Opéra and the district's Haussmann-style buildings.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>A hankering for some lunch leads you understandably to the nearby rue Sainte-Anne. In this emblematic hub of Japanese culture, sushi bars, home décor shops with hand painted signs and supermarkets packed with Japanese products stand side by side… Finally, you opt for a great ramen restaurant<em>,</em> tucked away down a street near the Palais-Royal. Kodawari Tsukiji will transport you into the vibrant atmosphere of Tokyo's former fish market. Amidst stalls dominated by perfect replicas of fish and shellfish, a waiter dressed as a fisherman serves you a <em>Sardine Bomb</em>, a thick broth of Brittany sardines, braised Basque Country farmhouse pork, and grilled spring onions. You leave delighted with this immersive taste experience.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Guided Tours of the Palais Garnier<br />\n</strong>Entrance at the corner of rues Scribe and Auber<br />\n75009 Paris<br />\nFrance<br />\n+33 (0)8 25 05 44 05<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.operadeparis.fr/en/visits/opera-paris\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.operadeparis.fr/en/visits/opera-paris</a></p>\n<p><strong>Kodawari Tsukiji<br />\n</strong>12 rue de Richelieu<br />\n75001 Paris<br />\nFrance<br />\n+33 (0)9 84 30 99 26<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.kodawari-ramen.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.kodawari-ramen.com</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>","picture":{"url":"https://img.static-af.com/images/media/995313B2-E271-4F50-98B80E7AE1425FFB/"}},{"text":"<p><strong>Spellbound in the île de la Cité</strong></p>\n<p>The banks of the Seine entice you to take a postprandial walk to the legendary Latin Quarter.

Visit the splendid Saint-Merri church with its flamboyant Gothic style, a little further on, before having something to drink on the terrace of one of the cafés in this very lively neighbourhood.</p>\n<p><strong>Centre National d'Art et de Culture Georges Pompidou</strong><br />\nPlace Georges Pompidou<br />\n75004 Paris</p>\n<p>+ 33 (0)1 44 78 12 33</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.centrepompidou.fr/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.centrepompidou.fr/en</a></p>","moreInfo":[{"geoCoordinates":{"longitude":"2°21'8.082\"E","latitude":"48°51'38.311\"N"}}]}]}}],"articlesSort":{"ALL":["212620","212566","212572","212582","212574","212578","212063","212061","212062","212064","212060","212019","212017","212013","212011","212015","209089","209095","209091","209079","209100","209083","203008","205949","203301","203002","202996","203006","203026","203041","203547","203039","203036","203022","197256","197252","197274","197278","197270","197286","197290","197262","197266","197282","196355","196108","195404","191230","191208","191272","191228","191262","191192","191200","191265","191172","191290","191248","191224","191212","191276","191168","191185","191220","191256","191288","191237","193203","154483","165468","165462","165459","165472","165469","165466","165478","165485","165465","165471","165460","165457","161998","162000","161988","154480","154482","154484","154479","154481","154470","154506","143750","142715","140967","110398","110402","107274","107300","139404","139414","139394","139458","139386","139380","139408","139446","124857","107276","119400","93551","83473","79311","66808","66813","66793","66826","17385","17166","17189","17251","17162","17362","17006","17135","17319","16901","17240","16852","17264","17183","17225","16709","16107","16046","16460","17147","15933","17260","16591","16639","16910","17083","17235","17158","16806","16183","16629","16975","16606","17081","17374","16344","16286","17133"],"RECENT_NEWS":["212620","196355","196108","195404"],"UNCATEGORIZED":["197266","191262","191290","191256"],"activity":["212566","212572","212582","212574","212578","212017","203002","202996","203547","203036","197290","196355","196108","161998","161988","154479","154506","140967","110402","16852","17183","16709","16107","16046","16460","15933","16591","16639","16910","17158","16629","16606","17081","17133"],"Gastronomy":["212620","212013","212011","212015","209089","209095","209091","209079","209100","209083","203301","203006","203041","203039","197256","197252","197274","197278","197270","197262","197282","195404","191230","191208","191272","191228","191192","191200","191265","191248","191224","191276","191168","191185","191220","191288","191237","193203","154483","165468","165462","165459","165469","165478","165485","165465","165471","165460","165457","162000","154480","154482","154484","154481","154470","143750","142715","110398","107300","139404","139414","139394","139458","139408","139446","107276","119400","83473","66808","66793","17385","17189","17162","17362","17135","17240","17260","17235","16183","16975","17374","16344","16286"],"Hotel":["212063","212061","212062","212064","212060","212019","203008","205949","203026","203022","197286","191172","191212","165472","165466","107274","139386","139380","124857","93551","79311","66813","66826","17166","17251","17006","17319","16901","17264","17225","17147","17083","16806"]},"desktopSettings":{"initialNumber":5,"paginationNumber":10},"mobileSettings":{"initialNumber":15,"paginationNumber":20},"priceCurrency":{"code":"EUR","symbol":"&euro;"},"practicalInfos":{"origin":{"code":"PAR","label":"Paris","canonicalName":"paris"},"destination":{"code":"PAR","label":"Paris"},"spokenLanguages":[{"code":"fr","language":"French"}],"time":{"timeZone":"GMT+01:00"},"weather":{"pictogramLabel":"fog","temperature":[{"value":8,"unit":"CELSIUS"}],"pictogramCode":"fog","pictogramUrlSvg":"","pictogramUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/media/02ADAE77-838C-480A-A4B655318DD57506","description":"","content":{"cityName":"Paris","title":"CLIMATE AND WEATHER IN Paris","introduction":"Paris has an oceanic climate, but experiences a wider range of temperatures and less rainfall than cities and towns on the Atlantic coast.
