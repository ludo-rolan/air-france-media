Just walking in the city will do that for you, as you gaze upon its monuments and works of art.</em></p>\n<p>There is a clearing in the forest where the Moskva River roars... this is the first perception of Moscow, from an airplane window approaching, from afar, one of the three international airports that surround this gigantic megalopolis.<br />\nThe second image comes from War and Peace, not the original 1865 Leo Tolstoy novel, but the 1956 King Vidor version, with Henry Fonda teetering on the window ledge, his back to the void, swallowing a bottle of vodka... He is Count Pierre Bezukhov at a party in St. Petersburg, despite the advance on Moscow of Napoleon's Grande Armée of 200,000 men. It's humanism and pacifism that teeter here, their backs to the void. It is the history of Russia.<br />\nThird image: the taxi taking you into Moscow. It's a wild free-for-all on these huge highways, where the emergency lanes serve as additional channels. You see, during these gigantic traffic jams, a little of the Moscow Oblast region, a hyper-industrialised basin where metallurgy, refining, the chemical industry, mechanical engineering, and food-processing plants compete for space in one of the most densely populated regions of the Federation.<br />\nYou will not find many birches in Moscow. Tolstoy writes: ‘Russia is not in Moscow, it is in the heart of her children.' Time to get to your hotel, in the centre of Moscow, where the charm has in no way dissipated. It's a strange charm, yes; due to the over-active nature of this huge city one feels feverish in its legendary decor, where even its beautiful metro is both palace and fortress ‘the People's Palace' as Stalin put it.<br />\nSince the end of the state-run restaurants and hotels, the city has quickly revolutionised its culinary and tourist offerings, which are constantly evolving, making any guide more than 18 months old hopelessly out of date. Here, information on the ground requires ceaseless renewal.

Come here to drink chocolate during the day,have a little dinner and a tête à tête in the evening, downstairs with candles, or upstairs in the library, and choose from the tremendously French and somewhat costly menu of Chef Andrei Makhov.</p>\n<p><strong>Café Pushkin<br />\n</strong>Tverskoy Blvd, 26А<br />\nMoscow 125009</p>\n<p>+7 495 739 00 33</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cafe-pushkin.ru\">www.cafe-pushkin.ru</a></p>\n<p>Menu: around 4,000 RU</p>","moreInfo":[{"geoCoordinates":{"longitude":"37°36'16.782\"E","latitude":"55°45'47.859\"N"}}]}]}},{"type":"POI","id":"13124","city":"MOW","country":"RU","region":"EUR","filters":[{"code":"GOURMET_ADVENTURES","label":"Food and Drink"}],"topic":"caucasus","publicationDate":"2016-02-13","isHidden":false,"isPartner":false,"isCrush":false,"content":{"title":"A tasty Azerbaijani menu at Barashka","introduction":{"small":"Barashka serves authentic cuisine from Baku in a European decor and design aesthetic that reveals its membership in the Novikov group."},"mainPicture":{"url":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/news/MOW/la-carte-savoureuse-de-l-azerbaidjan-au-barashka/MOW-la-carte-savoureuse-de-l-azerbaidjan-au-barashka-1_1-1024x1024.jpg","accessibilityDescription":"A tasty Azerbaijani menu at Barashka"},"paragraphs":[{"text":"<p>Celebrating the flavours of Azerbaijan, Barashka offers ethnic cuisine in an elegant atmosphere, a popular formula for upscale Muscovite foodies.
