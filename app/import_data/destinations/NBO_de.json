The Maasai Mara Village champions the concept: part of the dividends from the visits (KES 7,000 per day, including guide, meals and activities) goes to the SEMADEP Community Development Foundation that actively supports the Maasai community.<br />Small groups of 2 to 10 visitors are allowed in the village at a time.
