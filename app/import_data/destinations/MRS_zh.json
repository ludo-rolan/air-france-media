Today, it boasts a population of over one million: a population proud of their history and heritage. Spread over 57km of coastline, with 24 <em>calanques</em> (inlets), the city sets records for sunshine: up to 300 days a year.</p>\n<p>The visitor wanders through 26 centuries here, from Saint-Laurent hilltop, occupied since ancient times, to the Saint-Jean and Saint-Nicolas forts encircling the port, not to mention the churches and old streets, or the large architectural projects of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, such as the new Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilisations (Mucem).</p>\n<p>You have to walk - be a <em>flâneur</em> - in Marseille to capture the richness of its heritage and the myriad colours of its diversity and multiculturalism.</p>\n<p>Go to the old port and watch small fishing boats head out to sea and return. Visit the Panier, an authentic and popular neighbourhood of beautiful buildings, charming squares, and narrow streets. Climb up the Notre Dame de la Garde basilica, nicknamed the 'Good Mother', the guardian of sailors and fishermen, to admire the city in all its glory. Walk along the Prado beaches and contemplate the Calanques national park and its incredible local wildlife. Alternately, enjoy the same gorgeous scene from a different point of view: he sea! Sports enthusiasts will jump in a wetsuit and explore about a hundred diving spots around the area. Back on the land, go out for dinner in the spectacular dining establishments of a new generation of creative restaurateurs. Go shopping on rue Paradis in the Docks district. Life is good for the residents of this, the second largest city of France, and their warm smiles and singsong accents make your stay here pleasant and memorable. Oh, one more thing: do not leave the home of the “Radiant City” without trying the famous bouillabaisse, aioli, and fougasse.</p>","paragraph":[{"title":"","text":""}],"slideShow":{"topic":"","title":"","pictures":[{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MRS-2","imageAccessibility":"Marseille 2"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MRS-3","imageAccessibility":"Marseille 3"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MRS-4","imageAccessibility":"Marseille 4"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MRS-5","imageAccessibility":"Marseille 5"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MRS-6","imageAccessibility":"Marseille 6"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MRS-7","imageAccessibility":"Marseille 7"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MRS-8","imageAccessibility":"Marseille 8"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MRS-9","imageAccessibility":"Marseille 9"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MRS-10","imageAccessibility":"Marseille 10"}]},"mainVideo":{"videoTitle":"","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"144344802","sizes":[{"height":"360","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/144344802.sd.mp4?s=d0069476b407a08e90ca600dd7b40d260394614a&profile_id=164&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"720","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/144344802.hd.mp4?s=ca22576ea64beca0319d2c68b8f39d25fff6b910&profile_id=113&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"1080","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/144344802.hd.mp4?s=ca22576ea64beca0319d2c68b8f39d25fff6b910&profile_id=119&oauth2_token_id=911185232"}],"videoSource":"VIMEO","videoTopic":"","videoAccessibility":""},"otherVideos":[{"videoTitle":"Discover Marseille and surroundings","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"PvzOl0Ht5Ac","sizes":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PvzOl0Ht5Ac?loop=0&rel=0"}],"videoSource":"YOUTUBE","videoTopic":"Insight video","videoAccessibility":"","videoImageUrl":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/MRS/video/MRS-video-1_1-1024x1024.jpg"}],"map":{"introduction":"","mapTitle":"Our selection of must-see places in and around Marseille","mapId":"https://api.getwemap.com/customers/tbaf/points?destination=MRS&language=en&market=FR","mapUrl":"https://objects.airfrance.com/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/MRS/map/MRS-map.jpeg","mapTopic":"Discovery map","mapSource":"0","mapAccessibility":""},"seoData":{"seoTitle":"A city in perpetual motion -

Built by Protestant architect Henri Espérandieu, the Romano-Byzantine structure, also known as the ‘Good Mother', has two parts: a Roman-style crypt dug in the rock and a mosaic-decorated church. At the top stands the Virgin and Child.
