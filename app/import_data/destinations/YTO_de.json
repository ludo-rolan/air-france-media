A match at the ‘Hangar' during the season, which runs from September to April, is a must on any visit to Toronto.</p>\n<p>To get the most out of a match in a refined setting, dine at the club of the same name, and watch the game from the bar, or opt for the more exclusive Platinum Club, which has a wine list with over 500 references. Need to refresh your knowledge of hockey? Visit the Hall of Fame, located a few kilometres north. Dedicated to the legends of the sport, it offers souvenirs, trophies, and players' jerseys worn during historical games, and obviously, the famous Stanley Cup.</p>\n<p>Finally, do not miss the opportunity to score a goal at the exhibition ‘Be a Player', or stop a puck launched by Wayne Gretzky, simulated by computer.</p>\n<p><strong>Air Canada Centre</strong><br />\n40 Bay St<br />\nToronto<br />\nON M5J 2X2</p>\n<p><strong>Hockey Hall of Fame</strong><br />\n30 Yonge St<br />\nToronto<br />\nON M5E 1X8</p>\n<p>+1 416 815 5500</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.theaircanadacentre.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.theaircanadacentre.com</a></p>","moreInfo":[{"geoCoordinates":{"longitude":"79°22'44.78\"W","latitude":"43°38'36.598\"N"}}]}]}},{"type":"POI","id":"11880","city":"YTO","country":"CA","region":"AME","filters":[{"code":"ACCOMODATION","label":"Accommodation"}],"topic":"green hotel","publicationDate":"2016-02-15","isHidden":false,"isPartner":false,"isCrush":false,"content":{"title":"The Planet Traveler Hostel: sleep while respecting the environment","introduction":{"small":"The Planet Traveler is a ‘green hotel', an eco-hostel, where you can stay in environmentally friendly dorms or private rooms."},"mainPicture":{"url":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/news/YTO/dormir-en-respectant-l-environnement-au-planet-traveler/YTO-dormir-en-respectant-l-environnement-au-planet-traveler-1_1-1024x1024.jpg","accessibilityDescription":"The Planet Traveler Hostel: sleep while respecting the environment"},"paragraphs":[{"text":"<p>Housed in a building that was formerly abandoned, The Planet Traveler today offers elegant, opulent rooms and boasts of using ‘less electrical power than a four-slice toaster' daily.</p>\n<p>It's impossible not to notice the string of solar and photovoltaic panels that adorn its roof, which give the building a distinctively futuristic appearance.
