The old 19<sup>th</sup>-century factories now shelter trendy industrial lofts, vintage thrift shops, independent record stores and artist studios. Fashionistas gather at the Manchester Craft & Design Centre, where creators and local artists exhibit their work, whether with textiles, jewellery or ceramics… Bargain hunters and music collectors will explore Oldham Street, looking for hidden gems in second-hand shops and other boutiques specialised in old vinyl.
