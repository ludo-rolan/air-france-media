Indeed, this is not a classic play: there is no stage, no seating. The stunning actors lithely wander among the audience, throughout the experience. At the beginning of your adventure, you will be given a white mask that may remind you of the one worn in the film <em>Eyes Wide Shut</em>. Then you jump into the elevator where the rules of conduct are dictated: keep your mask on, don't talk, and keep moving about the building throughout the three hours. You can, if you wish, try to follow one particular character, who can provide the thread of the story for you. The characters are at once mysterious, suspicious, sensual, and endearing in their to-die-for Art Deco evening wear as they (almost) wordlessly dramatise the chic murder mystery and tormented love story better known as <em>Macbeth.</em> The drama takes you from floor to floor and messes with your mind as much as your physical perceptions. If <em>Sleep No More</em> is part of the site-specific theatre tradition, it also recalls a haunted house, with its ominous music, darkness, mysterious characters, and labyrinthine space.

Completed in 1883, it provides a walkway for pedestrians above and throughway for cars below, and is one of the oldest suspension bridges in the United States. At 1,825 metres long and 84 metres high, the bridge connects the southern districts of Manhattan to Brooklyn by spanning the East River. Crossing the famous bridge presents you with one of the best views of Manhattan. Though it is away from the most frequented pedestrian areas of the city, it is worth crossing the bridge on foot or by bike. Walkers have a reserved lane, above the cars, so you can look as closely as you like at the imposing steel cables above and to feel your soles vibrating due to the passing of the yellow cabs below. Crossing early in the morning or at sunset will give you a great view of the skyline of the Financial District and the glowing city. This is also the best time to trade in the excitement of Manhattan for the more relaxed atmosphere of Brooklyn. Make the most of the opportunity to discover the best of Brooklyn in Brooklyn Heights and the Brooklyn Bridge Park just off the end of the bridge, or, if you have good walking shoes, by descending Smith Street and exploring “BoCoCa”, short for the neighbourhoods of Boerum Hill, Cobble Hill, and Carroll Gardens.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/infrastructure/brooklyn-bridge.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.nyc.gov</a></p>","moreInfo":[{"geoCoordinates":{"longitude":"73°59'57.001\"W","latitude":"40°42'28.853\"N"}}]}]}},{"type":"POI","id":"3547","city":"NYC","country":"US","region":"AME","filters":[{"code":"MUST_SEE","label":"Must See"},{"code":"GOURMET_ADVENTURES","label":"Food and Drink"}],"topic":"market","publicationDate":"2016-02-15","isHidden":false,"isPartner":false,"isCrush":false,"content":{"title":"Chelsea Market: a jewel of a gourmet market in Chelsea","introduction":{"small":"There's nothing better than roaming Chelsea Market when hunger strikes."},"mainPicture":{"url":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/news/NYC/le-chelsea-market-le-boyau-gourmand-du-quartier-de-chelsea/NYC-le-chelsea-market-le-boyau-gourmand-du-quartier-de-chelsea-1_1-1024x1024.jpg","accessibilityDescription":"Chelsea Market: a jewel of a gourmet market in Chelsea"},"paragraphs":[{"text":"<p>The former factory in which the famed Oreo cookie was invented and produced has now become the favourite place for New York's gourmets.</p>\n<p>This 250-metre long building is home to many shops and stands swarming with tourists, locals, and food lovers in an authentic market atmosphere.
