Stretching your definition of gigantism and luxury, the style permeates the whole hotel, comprised of 170 rooms and suites. Stop by the rooftop and enjoy the biggest pool in all of the City of Angels with a view worthy of the best Hollywood films.<br />\nThe palace's decoration has been left in the hands of Frenchman Pierre-Yves Rochon, the superstar of interior designers. But the French touch does not stop at the various frescoes and Lalique crystals used: among the three hotel restaurants, you shouldn't miss the Jean-Georges, named after chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten.
