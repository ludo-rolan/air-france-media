The largest, posed like a butterfly in the middle of the water, is called 'Karukera' in Amerindian. Its mountainous topography, flourishing nature, and the diversity of its beaches make it the most spectacular of the archipelago's islands. It has two regions: Grande-Terre and Basse-Terre.</p>\n<p>Grande Terre, the right wing of the butterfly, is flat and arid, and is the most popular tourist area with the most beautiful beaches. The shores of golden sand are lined with coconut trees and lapped by crystal-clear water. It is a paradise for water sports enthusiasts. Most hotels are located on its coast, notably in Le Gosier, Sainte-Anne, Saint-François, and along to the Pointe des Châteaux. Not far away, Pointe-à-Pitre forms the head of this beautiful butterfly, while Basse-Terre, mountainous and green, is the left wing. This region is a veritable lush Garden of Eden where the La Soufrière volcano takes centre stage. A heavenly spot for divers, Basse-Terre is also much-loved by hikers for Guadeloupe National Park: a tropical forest dotted with waterfalls, vertical drops, trails lined with ancient trees, and black sand beaches.</p>\n<p>A few nautical miles away are the southern islands, with poetic names like Marie-Galante, Petite-Terre, La Désirade, and Les Saintes evoking enchanting lagoons, protected wildlife, and unspoiled nature. The Petite-Terre Reserve is an iguana paradise. Marie-Galante, known for its beaches and rum, offers a journey back in time, far from the more popular tourist haunts. La Désirade, often compared to the island of Robinson Crusoe, inspires calm with its heavenly beaches and deserted landscapes. Les Saintes offers an unparalleled spectacle, featuring one of the most beautiful bays in the world.</p>\n<p>You will be amazed by so much beauty and diversity, with something to suit everyone: from ideal spots for sitting back and relaxing, to sports and exploring. With temperatures of 27°C and waters at 25°C all year round, a trip to Guadeloupe promises to be an absolute joy.

There are two distinct seasons on the islands: a dry season known as Carême (Lent) from December to April, and a rainy season, called Hivernage (Wintering) from mid-June to November, when there are frequent, intense bouts of rainfall.<br />\n<br />The weather remains warm year-round, with an annual average of 27°C (81°F). During the warmest months, the temperature ranges from 25°C to 32°C (77°F to 90°F) on average, while it varies between 23°C and 29°C (73°F and 84°F) on average during the coldest ones. Hurricane season in Guadeloupe runs from May to November. Rainfall can be heavy from August to November. But with record-setting sunshine (nearly 3,000 hours each year) and water temperatures of 28°C (82°F) on average, Guadeloupe is still a dream destination.","monthInformation":[{"month":"JANUARY","isBestMonth":true,"minTempCelsius":"21","maxTempCelsius":"29","minTempFarenheit":"70","maxTempFarenheit":"84","rainMm":"83","bestMonth":true},{"month":"FEBRUARY","isBestMonth":true,"minTempCelsius":"20","maxTempCelsius":"29","minTempFarenheit":"68","maxTempFarenheit":"84","rainMm":"60","bestMonth":true},{"month":"MARCH","isBestMonth":true,"minTempCelsius":"21","maxTempCelsius":"29","minTempFarenheit":"70","maxTempFarenheit":"86","rainMm":"70","bestMonth":true},{"month":"APRIL","isBestMonth":true,"minTempCelsius":"22","maxTempCelsius":"30","minTempFarenheit":"72","maxTempFarenheit":"86","rainMm":"96","bestMonth":true},{"month":"MAY","isBestMonth":true,"minTempCelsius":"24","maxTempCelsius":"31","minTempFarenheit":"75","maxTempFarenheit":"88","rainMm":"134","bestMonth":true},{"month":"JUNE","isBestMonth":true,"minTempCelsius":"24","maxTempCelsius":"31","minTempFarenheit":"75","maxTempFarenheit":"88","rainMm":"108","bestMonth":true},{"month":"JULY","isBestMonth":false,"minTempCelsius":"24","maxTempCelsius":"32","minTempFarenheit":"75","maxTempFarenheit":"90","rainMm":"130","bestMonth":false},{"month":"AUGUST","isBestMonth":false,"minTempCelsius":"24","maxTempCelsius":"32","minTempFarenheit":"75","maxTempFarenheit":"90","rainMm":"169","bestMonth":false},{"month":"SEPTEMBER","isBestMonth":false,"minTempCelsius":"24","maxTempCelsius":"32","minTempFarenheit":"75","maxTempFarenheit":"90","rainMm":"206","bestMonth":false},{"month":"OCTOBER","isBestMonth":false,"minTempCelsius":"23","maxTempCelsius":"31","minTempFarenheit":"73","maxTempFarenheit":"88","rainMm":"214","bestMonth":false},{"month":"NOVEMBER","isBestMonth":false,"minTempCelsius":"22","maxTempCelsius":"30","minTempFarenheit":"72","maxTempFarenheit":"86","rainMm":"214","bestMonth":false},{"month":"DECEMBER","isBestMonth":true,"minTempCelsius":"21","maxTempCelsius":"30","minTempFarenheit":"70","maxTempFarenheit":"86","rainMm":"134","bestMonth":true}]}},"currency":{"data":{"code":"EUR","label":"Euro","rate":1,"symbol":"&#8364;"},"content":{"title":"Currency and Exchange Rates","description":"<p>The currency used in Guadeloupe is the Euro (EUR). </p>","validity":"The above exchange rate is given for information because is variable."}},"airports":{"title":"Guadeloupe Pointe-à-Pitre Le Raizet Airport","description":"The International airport of Guadeloupe Pointe-à-Pitre Le Raizet is located about 7km (4 miles) north of the city of Pointe-à-Pitre.<br />\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Two terminals:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Terminal 1 (Air France)</li>\n<li>Terminal 2</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br /><strong>Getting from the airport to Pointe-à-Pitre and back:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>By car\n<ul>\n<li>Accessible via Rue Pompilius Keller: journey takes around <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">15</span> 16 minutes.</li>\n<li>There are three parking facilities: P0 (drop-off, first 10 minutes are free), P1 (short-term parking, first 10 minutes are free, then EUR 4 for 1 hour) and P2 (long-term parking, EUR 30 for 24 hours then EUR 5 per extra day)</li>\n<li>Several car rental companies have counters at the airport.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>By taxi\n<ul>\n<li>Taxis are available just outside the airport.
