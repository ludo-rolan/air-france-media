With over 40% of the island a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it is one of the few destinations where one can experience so many sensations in a single trip.</p>\n<p>Réunion abounds with fabulous coral reefs brimming with myriad colourful species. It is a paradise for snorkelers and diving aficionados. And there are other water sports aplenty, from surfing and canyoning to water skiing and deep-sea fishing.</p>\n<p>The distance between land and sea is but a step, so it is easy to discover the island's rich natural resources, its spectacular natural features, and tropical gardens abundant with extraordinary indigenous flora and fauna. Réunion has many treasures including three natural cirques shaped by the erosion of the Piton des Neiges, the highest peak in the Indian Ocean: the Cilaos mineral cirque, Mafate with its exhilarating wilderness and Salazie with its profusion of lush green. It is a timeless setting. Nature lovers are spellbound by the island's grandiose views, the many forest walks bursting with blooms, treks around the immensity of the cirque ramparts and the island's magnificent waterfalls.</p>\n<p>For an even greater thrill, take a helicopter flight over the island and discover its endless contrasts. The panoramic views of the landscape at the heart of the Piton de la Fournaise, one of the most active volcanoes in the world, are stupendous. During your rapid ascent, you will also get to see the exceptional, lunar desert-like terrain of the Sand Plains, and the Pas de Bellecombe mountain pass, before reaching the crater: a stunning sight in itself, and undoubtedly an unforgettable moment.</p>\n<p>The island boasts architectural heritage, a journey through time amongst the legendary Réunion monuments tracing the origins of Creole culture. And awaken your senses with the exoticism of the island's cuisine, a colourful mix and blend of influences.</p>\n<p>An exhilarating adventure awaits you in this open-air paradise. With its infinite charm, exotic sweetness, warm atmosphere, and lush nature, you will be carried away by the magic of this unique island, which never ceases to amaze.</p>","paragraph":[{"title":"","text":""}],"slideShow":{"topic":"","title":"","pictures":[{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-RUN-2","imageAccessibility":"SAINT-DENIS DE LA RÉUNION 2"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-RUN-3","imageAccessibility":"SAINT-DENIS DE LA RÉUNION 3"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-RUN-4","imageAccessibility":"SAINT-DENIS DE LA RÉUNION 4"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-RUN-5","imageAccessibility":"SAINT-DENIS DE LA RÉUNION 5"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-RUN-6","imageAccessibility":"SAINT-DENIS DE LA RÉUNION 6"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-RUN-7","imageAccessibility":"SAINT-DENIS DE LA RÉUNION 7"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-RUN-8","imageAccessibility":"SAINT-DENIS DE LA RÉUNION 8"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-RUN-9","imageAccessibility":"SAINT-DENIS DE LA RÉUNION 9"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-RUN-10","imageAccessibility":"SAINT-DENIS DE LA RÉUNION 10"}]},"mainVideo":{"videoTitle":"","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"152540562","sizes":[{"height":"360","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/152540562.sd.mp4?s=02056ee3f93833f39e414eeaf8168b14448da13d&profile_id=112&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"720","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/152540562.hd.mp4?s=200e2f6101c5666f5055a28a137bbe9109ffbb38&profile_id=113&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"1080","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/152540562.hd.mp4?s=200e2f6101c5666f5055a28a137bbe9109ffbb38&profile_id=119&oauth2_token_id=911185232"}],"videoSource":"VIMEO","videoTopic":"","videoAccessibility":""},"otherVideos":[{"videoTitle":"Discover Saint-Denis  and surroundings","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"WhvlVR6geKo","sizes":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WhvlVR6geKo?loop=0&rel=0"}],"videoSource":"YOUTUBE","videoTopic":"Insight video","videoAccessibility":"","videoImageUrl":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/RUN/video/RUN-video-1_1-1024x1024.jpg"}],"map":{"introduction":"","mapTitle":"Our selection of must-see places in Réunion","mapId":"https://api.getwemap.com/customers/tbaf/points?destination=RUN&language=en&market=FR","mapUrl":"https://objects.airfrance.com/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/RUN/map/RUN-map.jpeg","mapTopic":"Discovery map","mapSource":"0","mapAccessibility":""},"seoData":{"seoTitle":"Réunion, the majestic island of the Indian Ocean -
