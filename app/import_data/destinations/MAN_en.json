Red brick walls make for a large part of the urban panorama, giving the north-western city a “small New York” feel. Most of the remnants of the Industrial era have been turned into lofts, office spaces and artist studios, which passersby can marvel at while strolling along the canals of Castlefield. Various other factories and warehouses will delight urban explorers looking for abandoned sites, where nature reasserts itself.<br />\nThe city actually invests in that underground aspect, which you are likely to come across on every street corner. Northern Quarter is one of the defining landmarks of English alternative culture, even more so than London's punkish Camden Town. You will constantly be on the lookout for street art frescoes, whether of political and artistical overtones, or simply representing Manchester bees, the city's heraldic symbol. Enter one of its many art galleries and discover daring contemporary works of art, 500-year old Japanese etchings as well as mid-20th-century paintings by Laurence Stephen Lowry, who visually told the industrial history of the region. Manchester has always been on the forefront of global and historical heritage preservation, which you can attest to in its many libraries, full of unique manuscripts, some being several-millennia old.<br />\nIt is getting dark and the streets are filled with energy. It is happy hour time in the pubs. And on game nights, the atmosphere is electric. Fans of Manchester United are dressed in red while Manchester City supporters wear blue. The two legendary teams make England proud and compete each year to win the most prestigious national and European cups. Manchester is also the embodiment of rock n' roll. It is the birthplace of bands like The Smiths, Joy Division and even Oasis, offering them a springboard before rising to worldwide fame and leaving their marks in the world of music. Capital of counterculture, the city's strong character proves fascinating. Experiment the outdoor stages and various festivals, and explore the indomitable soul of Madchester, as it is affectionately nicknamed, forever rebellious.</p>","paragraph":[{"title":"","text":""}],"slideShow":{"topic":"","title":"","pictures":[{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MAN-2","imageAccessibility":"Manchester 2"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MAN-3","imageAccessibility":"Manchester 3"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MAN-4","imageAccessibility":"Manchester 4"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MAN-5","imageAccessibility":"Manchester 5"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MAN-6","imageAccessibility":"Manchester 6"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MAN-7","imageAccessibility":"Manchester 7"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MAN-8","imageAccessibility":"Manchester 8"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MAN-9","imageAccessibility":"Manchester 9"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MAN-10","imageAccessibility":"Manchester 10"}]},"mainVideo":{"videoTitle":"","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"351173454","sizes":[{"height":"360","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/351173454.sd.mp4?s=ed65ef1542441fd97e3cca45b37133c38d3cb5fb&profile_id=164&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"720","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/351173454.hd.mp4?s=47e9a521946023c4fb4f6b07b15aafa1df7d58b6&profile_id=174&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"1080","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/351173454.hd.mp4?s=47e9a521946023c4fb4f6b07b15aafa1df7d58b6&profile_id=175&oauth2_token_id=911185232"}],"videoSource":"VIMEO","videoTopic":"","videoAccessibility":""},"otherVideos":[{"videoTitle":"Discover Manchester and surroundings","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"Nsg94PsV9is","sizes":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nsg94PsV9is?loop=0&rel=0"}],"videoSource":"YOUTUBE","videoTopic":"Insight video","videoAccessibility":"","videoImageUrl":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/MAN/video/MAN-video-1_1-1024x1024.jpg"}],"map":{"introduction":"","mapTitle":"Our selection of must-see places in and around Manchester","mapId":"https://api.getwemap.com/customers/tbaf/points?destination=MAN&language=en&market=FR","mapUrl":"https://objects.airfrance.com/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/MAN/map/MAN-map.jpeg","mapTopic":"Discovery map","mapSource":"0","mapAccessibility":""},"seoData":{"seoTitle":"The Spirit of Rock n' Roll","seoDescription":"Boasting a long history of industrial achievements, and at once cradle of football and alternative rock music, Manchester will bring out the rebel hiding in each of us.","seoKeywords":"","seoFooter":""}},"newDestination":false},"practicalInformationCategories":{"destinationTime":"11:28","destinationWeather":{"weatherUnit":"CELSIUS","temperatureValue":"9","pictogramUrlSvg":"","pictogramUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/media/3646B953-6931-4D2F-97886B69A3CF7E33"},"destinationSpokenLanguages":[{"code":"en","label":"English"}],"destinationFlightTime":"1H25","titles":{"medical":{"title":"Medical information"},"goodToKnow":{"title":"Good to know"},"localCalendar":{"title":"FESTIVALS, HOLIDAYS AND OTHER ANNUAL EVENTS IN Manchester"},"weather":{"title":"CLIMATE AND WEATHER IN Manchester"},"currency":{"title":"Currency and Exchange Rates"},"touristInformation":{"title":"Visitor information"},"airports":{"title":"Manchester International Airport"},"transportation":{"title":"GETTING AROUND Manchester"}},"currency":{"data":{"label":"Pound Sterling","symbol":"&#163;"}}},"lowestPrice":108,"alternateDestinations":[{"code":"ATH","label":"Athens","lowestPrice":106,"canonicalName":"athens"},{"code":"BCN","label":"Barcelona","lowestPrice":99,"canonicalName":"barcelona"},{"code":"BOD","label":"Bordeaux","lowestPrice":101,"canonicalName":"bordeaux"},{"code":"BOG","label":"Bogota","lowestPrice":481,"canonicalName":"bogota"}],"destinationCountry":{"code":"GB","label":"United Kingdom","pictureUrl":"//objects.airfrance.com/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/countries/GB/GB-1_1-768x768.jpg","latitude":"54","longitude":"2","travelGuide":{"isTravelGuideAvailable":false,"travelGuideUrl":""}},"destinationRegion":{"code":"EUR","label":"Europe","pictureUrl":"//objects.airfrance.com/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/inspiration/regions/EUR.svg","latitude":"56","longitude":"25","travelGuide":{"isTravelGuideAvailable":false,"travelGuideUrl":""}},"articles":[{"type":"POI","id":"174861","city":"MAN","country":"GB","region":"EUR","filters":[{"code":"MUST_SEE","label":"Must See"}],"topic":"exploration -

Since the Cities of Hope Festival in 2016, Manchester has become a landmark of street art, its walls covered by major figures: C215, Tankpetrol, Akse… The artists conceive huge murals, especially around Piccadilly Gardens and on Tib Street, displaying various references to pop culture, as well as in the Ancoats district, bordering Northern Quarter.</p>\n<p>In the world of street art, landscapes change rapidly: a graffiti may disappear overnight and be replaced by a new one. Some frescoes put up some resistance, like the iconic portrait of David Bowie on Stevenson Square, or the giant chickadee spread over Port Street's red-brick wall. Venture out and look for them randomly, or during a tour set up by the Art Battle Manchester art group.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://artbattle.co.uk\" target=\"_BLANK\">http://artbattle.co.uk</a></p>","moreInfo":[{"geoCoordinates":{"longitude":"2°14'4.124\"W","latitude":"53°28'57.176\"N"}}]}]}},{"type":"POI","id":"174865","city":"MAN","country":"GB","region":"EUR","filters":[{"code":"ACCOMODATION","label":"Accommodation"}],"topic":"boutique hotel - retro","publicationDate":"2019-06-10","isHidden":false,"isPartner":false,"isCrush":false,"content":{"title":"Discretion at King Street Townhouse","introduction":{"small":"Two steps away from the Manchester Central Library, King Street Townhouse is a refined stop that hides one of the most beautiful sights in the city."},"mainPicture":{"url":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/news/MAN/en-toute-discretion-au-king-street-townhouse/MAN-en-toute-discretion-au-king-street-townhouse-1_1-1024x1024.jpg","accessibilityDescription":"Discretion at King Street Townhouse"},"paragraphs":[{"text":"<p>The Renaissance facade conceals an extraordinary boutique hotel: King Street Townhouse.
