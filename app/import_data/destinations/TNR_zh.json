Madagascar, crossroads of many worlds, promises an exceptional journey.</em></p>\n<p>Millions of years ago, the warm waters of the Mozambique Channel broke off a large section of red earth from the continent, creating the fifth largest island in the world, here in the Indian Ocean. Of its continental roots, Madagascar has conserved its breath-taking nature, which is not easily tamed. Indeed, this beautiful island is even a sort of Noah's Ark in that it preserves endemic fauna and flora from the mainland: six species of baobab tree remain here and are now emblematic of the 'Red Island', while Africa has only one left today. You will also find colonies of mischievous lemurs, colourful frogs, starred turtles, coelacanths, and tenrecs.</p>\n<p>Madagascar plays with paradoxes. Here the savannah meets the rice paddies, brought by immigrants from Asia, who make up the majority on the island. To the east, the heavy rains of the Indian Ocean irrigate a lush rainforest. In the highlands, colonial buildings break with the adobe houses. Elsewhere the sugar cane, pepper, ylang-ylang, and vanilla plantations send up their scents into a spicy air; later these same aromas escape the kitchens of the island's traditional restaurants. There is indeed good reason for another of its nickname: the 'Perfume Island'.</p>\n<p>Madagascar is an enigmatic place. The multiculturalism, ancestor worship, and taboos perpetuated by Indonesian and African ethnic groups, as well as crafts that have become high art, all promise travellers extraordinary experiences, both surprising and intimate. You may find yourself in a bush taxi exploring an impassable ochre path that seems to lead to the end of the world, but the island is also known to seduce more than ecotourism enthusiasts. Nosy Be and its islands, with their pristine sand beaches and blue lagoons, are made for relaxation, and you will find precious hotels and luxury resorts for modern Robinson Crusoes who love nature and open spaces.</p>","paragraph":[{"title":"","text":""}],"slideShow":{"topic":"","title":"","pictures":[{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-TNR-2","imageAccessibility":"Antananarivo 2"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-TNR-3","imageAccessibility":"Antananarivo 3"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-TNR-4","imageAccessibility":"Antananarivo 4"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-TNR-5","imageAccessibility":"Antananarivo 5"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-TNR-6","imageAccessibility":"Antananarivo 6"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-TNR-7","imageAccessibility":"Antananarivo 7"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-TNR-8","imageAccessibility":"Antananarivo 8"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-TNR-9","imageAccessibility":"Antananarivo 9"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-TNR-10","imageAccessibility":"Antananarivo 10"}]},"mainVideo":{"videoTitle":"","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"164065997","sizes":[{"height":"360","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/164065997.sd.mp4?s=90e5e951e20ef4cff274801d53c2b5f19a498b69&profile_id=164&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"720","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/164065997.hd.mp4?s=c3114026ab133f4626dde5c27ccbdbfe82965887&profile_id=174&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"1080","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/164065997.hd.mp4?s=c3114026ab133f4626dde5c27ccbdbfe82965887&profile_id=119&oauth2_token_id=911185232"}],"videoSource":"VIMEO","videoTopic":"","videoAccessibility":""},"otherVideos":[{"videoTitle":"Discover Antananarivo and surroundings","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"qZvIowCIhHg","sizes":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qZvIowCIhHg?loop=0&rel=0"}],"videoSource":"YOUTUBE","videoTopic":"Insight video","videoAccessibility":"","videoImageUrl":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/TNR/video/TNR-video-1_1-1024x1024.jpg"}],"map":{"introduction":"","mapTitle":"Our selection of must-see places in Madagascar","mapId":"https://api.getwemap.com/customers/tbaf/points?destination=TNR&language=en&market=FR","mapUrl":"https://objects.airfrance.com/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/TNR/map/TNR-map.jpeg","mapTopic":"Discovery map","mapSource":"0","mapAccessibility":""},"seoData":{"seoTitle":"The Malagasy exception – Antananarivo Travel Guide","seoDescription":"Few destinations can boast such a unique face beyond the postcard image of white sand, turquoise waters, and bright sun.

From this peninsula, the boat takes you to Nosy Komba island, the second largest of Madagascar's islands after Nosy Be. Yet it is only eight kilometres in diameter! You are about to witness a total change of scenery in the heart of extraordinary landscapes. Once you have disembarked onto this ancient volcanic island completely covered with tropical forest, you soon understand why you can only visit Nosy Komba on foot. Here there are no roads, only paths through nature between gigantic trees, surrounded by fruit and flowers.</p>\n<p>You can't wait to discover this luxuriant nature by going hiking. There is something to suit all ages and all levels. Keen hikers won't be able to resist climbing the Antaninaomby peak, the volcano from which the island originates. It takes a good five to six hours surrounded by rosewood trees, banana trees and orchid vines to reach the summit. The view from the crater's ridge, which peaks at an altitude of 622 metres, is absolutely incredible, and is well worth the effort. Delight in the 360° panorama on the archipelago of <a href=\"../../common/travel-guide/nosy-be-a-true-island-paradise.htm\">Nosy Be</a> and on the coasts of the main island.

A species endemic to Madagascar, these wide-eyed primates are everywhere and have cult status among the local population, which is committed to their protection. Listen carefully to the sounds in the trees to pick up their vocalisations, keep a keen eye out for those small, agile creatures that live in the trees of the thick, protective and nourishing forest, and where mangoes, persimmons, and soursops grow in abundance.</p>\n<p>There are many other animals to be observed on the island, especially during an excursion around the village of Ampangorina in the north, which is accessible to all. To discover this biodiversity, you can enlist a guide from the Tourist Office. He will take you to meet the maki macaco (a species of lemuriform primate), chameleons, lizards or turtles. Also take advantage of your visit to the main village of Nosy Komba to admire the <a href=\"../../../../common/travel-guide/malagasy-embroidery.htm\">work of the embroiderers</a>. With nimble fingers that master the Richelieu stitch to perfection, these women make colourful cotton tablecloths that depict scenes from Malagasy folklore and the island's flora.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, go to Villa Nofiko. The green forest is blooming all around you. You admire the tranquil water from your deckchair on a wooden pontoon. You find absolute calm in these preserved surroundings. Here, everything is designed and built around nature, starting with the single-storey architecture of the building where you are staying. Octagonal in shape, it blends perfectly into the landscape. Similarly, electricity is supplied by solar panels. The hanging garden offers all the fruit and vegetables you will need for cooking: papaya, cacao, vanilla, coconut, mango, bananas or breadfruit (which has a similar taste to sweet potatoes) etc. Not forgetting the bougainvillea, frangipani and ylang-ylang flowers.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>If you suffer a small injury or illness during your stay on the island, ask to see Mrs. Yvonne. This healer, who is almost 80 years old, knows all the plants, their medicinal properties and their correct usage.

To get there, you take a boat from Nosy Be, neighbouring Nosy Komba. After an hour and a half of fast sailing, you have before you the picture postcard you always dreamed of: a turquoise blue, crystalline sea, casually leaning coconut trees, immaculately white beaches. Everything is in place for an escape like no other.</p>\n<p>The order of the day is to savour every moment that passes. It is up to you whether you simply laze on the sand or go snorkelling and discover the underwater fauna, featuring sea turtles and manta rays, as impressive as they are majestic. The tuna, parrotfish, spinner dolphins, groupers and swordfish are unmissable. Humpback whales are the main attraction from July to October, with whale sharks following close behind.
