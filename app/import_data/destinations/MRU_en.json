This small English- and French-speaking island in the Indian Ocean, which has been independent since 1968, has a diverse cultural background, which includes Portuguese, Dutch, French, and English influences. This historical mix has shaped its identity and unique cultural richness.</p>\n<p>Discover the enchanted wilderness and tranquillity of the south of the island, its coves, deserted beaches, and marine cemeteries, while skilled fingers strike the ravane, a large flat drum and the main instrument of Sega, the traditional music of African slaves. A little further west, the majestic Morne Mountain watches over chic hotels that nestle along the peninsula. The decor seems straight out of a painting with a deep blue sea, dazzling white beaches, and dark-green coconuts.</p>\n<p>Taking the road north, we suggest a colourful and lively stopover in Mahébourg, where street vendors set up their wares on Mondays. Sugarcane fields and tea plantations stretch in all directions, and the sublime scents of frangipani, hibiscus, and anthuriums are all around the many Indian temples. With barely time to recover from these heady adventures, the Grand Bay and its harbour appear. From there it is on to Port Louis, the capital, with its waterfront shops and animated market, which offers myriad exotic fragrances, enlivening all the senses.</p>\n<p>There is no need for equivocation: Mauritius will conquer you.</p>","paragraph":[{"title":"","text":""}],"slideShow":{"topic":"","title":"","pictures":[{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MRU-2","imageAccessibility":"Mauritius 2"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MRU-3","imageAccessibility":"Mauritius 3"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MRU-4","imageAccessibility":"Mauritius 4"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MRU-5","imageAccessibility":"Mauritius 5"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MRU-6","imageAccessibility":"Mauritius 6"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MRU-7","imageAccessibility":"Mauritius 7"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MRU-8","imageAccessibility":"Mauritius 8"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MRU-9","imageAccessibility":"Mauritius 9"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MRU-10","imageAccessibility":"Mauritius 10"}]},"mainVideo":{"videoTitle":"","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"152549485","sizes":[{"height":"360","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/152549485.sd.mp4?s=5895db7c47596a87803a1a0ad8984dee280e9e56&profile_id=112&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"720","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/152549485.hd.mp4?s=eec5096afe4d45d21f6aa2ecce39f35b3c16cee7&profile_id=113&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"1080","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/152549485.hd.mp4?s=eec5096afe4d45d21f6aa2ecce39f35b3c16cee7&profile_id=119&oauth2_token_id=911185232"}],"videoSource":"VIMEO","videoTopic":"","videoAccessibility":""},"otherVideos":[{"videoTitle":"Discover Mauritius and surroundings","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"u6r7SIEVMVY","sizes":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/u6r7SIEVMVY?loop=0&rel=0"}],"videoSource":"YOUTUBE","videoTopic":"Insight video","videoAccessibility":"","videoImageUrl":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/MRU/video/MRU-video-1_1-1024x1024.jpg"}],"map":{"introduction":"","mapTitle":"Our selection of must-see places in Mauritius","mapId":"https://api.getwemap.com/customers/tbaf/points?destination=MRU&language=en&market=FR","mapUrl":"https://objects.airfrance.com/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/MRU/map/MRU-map.jpeg","mapTopic":"Discovery map","mapSource":"0","mapAccessibility":""},"seoData":{"seoTitle":"Travel Guide Plaisance  - Plan your trip to Plaisance with Air France Travel Guide","seoDescription":"Stay in Plaisance: what to visit to Plaisance, where to stay, which restaurant to go?
