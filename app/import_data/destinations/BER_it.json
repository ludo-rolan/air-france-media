Embark on a riverboat or a steamboat and navigate to the city centre, passing under famous bridges such as the Oberbaumbrücke and Schlossbrücke, and gliding past monuments like the Bellevue Palace, the Berlin Cathedral, and Museum Island. The cruise takes you to the Saint-Nicolas district, the oldest part of the city, where you will see modern architecture like the Haus der Kulturen der Welt and Norman Foster's dome on the renovated Reichstag. You can also explore the hipster scene in East Berlin or cruise on Lake Wannsee and the Havel River to learn more about the history of the region.</p>\n<p><strong>Reederei</strong><strong> Riedel</strong><br />+49 (0)30 62 93 31 94<br /><a href=\"https://reederei-riedel.de/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-mce-href=\"https://reederei-riedel.de/en/\">https://reederei-riedel.de/en/</a></p>\n<p><strong>Stern & Kreisschiffahrt</strong><br />+49 (0)30 53 63 600<br /><a href=\"https://www.sternundkreis.de/en/Startseite/E1001.htm?_sm_au_=iHVMrWLj86pDnqVqjkM0vKQ6c702G\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-mce-href=\"https://www.sternundkreis.de/en/Startseite/E1001.htm?_sm_au_=iHVMrWLj86pDnqVqjkM0vKQ6c702G\">https://www.sternundkreis.de/en/Startseite/E1001.htm?_sm_au_=iHVMrWLj86pDnqVqjkM0vKQ6c702G</a></p>\n<p><strong>BWSG Berliner Wassersport und Service GmbH</strong><br />+49 (0)30 65 13 415<br /><a href=\"https://www.bwsg-berlin.de/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-mce-href=\"https://www.bwsg-berlin.de/en/\">https://www.bwsg-berlin.de/en/</a></p>"}]}},{"type":"POI","id":"7296","city":"BER","country":"DE","region":"EUR","filters":[{"code":"MUST_SEE","label":"Must See"},{"code":"SPORTS_AND_WELL_BEING","label":"Sports and Well-being"}],"topic":"park","publicationDate":"2016-02-13","isHidden":false,"isPartner":false,"isCrush":false,"content":{"title":"Family picnic at Großer Tiergarten","introduction":{"small":"Stroll through the oldest park in the city, and enjoy its 32 km of trails for a natural experience in the heart of the metropolis."},"mainPicture":{"url":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/news/BER/pique-niquer-au-grosser-tiergarten/BER-pique-niquer-au-grosser-tiergarten-1_1-1024x1024.jpg","accessibilityDescription":"Family picnic at Großer Tiergarten"},"paragraphs":[{"text":"<p>A former game reserve, the Großer Tiergarten ('animal garden') is home to many wild animals. So many, in fact, that the municipality has even mandated 35 urban hunters to fight against the proliferation of game.

Berliners like to come here for walks, family picnics, bike tours, games of football, Sunday barbecues, or to sit at the lakeside café.

The owners, Boris Radczun and art collector Stefan Landwehr, have created the luxury steakhouse of their dreams. Wagyu beef from Australia, filet mignon, and steaks are the specialties of the house.

To enter Cookies Cream, you have to go through the service entrance of the Westin Grand Berlin and press an unmarked buzzer. Upstairs, after going in the back door, you land in an industrial space with raw concrete walls, an open kitchen, and tables draped in linen where flavourful vegetarian dishes are being served. In this abandoned loft atmosphere, all very Berlin, the ingredients are always ultra-fresh and seasonal, and the menu changes every week. Stephan Hentschel, the chef, has a number of signature dishes, including parmesan dumplings, fried egg yolks with lentils, and wild herb salad. The staff is laid-back and the crowd very friendly, mainly clubbers from the famous Cookie just downstairs, financial types in suits, and lovers on holiday.
