Its heart beats in the shade of the Table Mountain, a very urban mount that can be reached in a cable car. Cape Town knows how to live. You will love to drink from the surrounding vineyards, a legacy of the Huguenots, and taste the products of nearby farms. With nature so very close by, you may be reminded of another southern city, Sydney, Australia. Both share the barbecue culture though things cook on the <em>braai</em> here in Cape Town, as they do on the <em>barbie</em> in Oz. Both have long histories as cultural melting pots as well, with some bumps and bruises acquired along the way. But today friendliness and smiles have triumphed over the most brazen inequalities. Though apartheid is now in the past, Cape Town continues to heal its wounds, its best assets today being culture and the art of fine living. You will be amazed by what you will find here in this churning cauldron of creativity. The city continues its momentum after 2014, when it was crowned World Design Capital. Since then, designers, creative types of all genres, and contemporary art galleries have been flourishing, especially in the emerging area of Woodstock. A new wind is blowing along the Victoria &amp; Alfred Waterfront, as well, where the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art opened in 2017. Here, Rastafarians run into suits, and models are on the arms of hipsters. From a forgotten time, the downtown, with its eclectic mix of Victorian, Edwardian, and Art Deco styles, is also being reborn, primarily through the many gourmet addresses around Bree Street. The culinary revolution is well and truly on. To see up close the sumptuous surrounding areas, you may take the Garden Route, with its magnificent views out over the waves along the way. Indeed, Cape Town bewitches. Is it the way the light strikes the town? The sea air? The aftertaste of an excellent Rooibos tea, unique in the world? Or the call of nature that you can sense just behind Table Mountain? No doubt it's a unique combination of all of the above. More than just interesting, Cape Town is an engaging place. It's a Mother City worth the trip.</p>","paragraph":[{"title":"","text":""}],"slideShow":{"topic":"","title":"","pictures":[{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-CPT-2","imageAccessibility":"Cape Town 2"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-CPT-3","imageAccessibility":"Cape Town 3"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-CPT-4","imageAccessibility":"Cape Town 4"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-CPT-5","imageAccessibility":"Cape Town 5"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-CPT-6","imageAccessibility":"Cape Town 6"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-CPT-7","imageAccessibility":"Cape Town 7"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-CPT-8","imageAccessibility":"Cape Town 8"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-CPT-9","imageAccessibility":"Cape Town 9"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-CPT-10","imageAccessibility":"Cape Town 10"}]},"mainVideo":{"videoTitle":"","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"261456057","sizes":[{"height":"360","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/261456057.sd.mp4?s=4ed6536fc05159b83e0374806974c6abd03d530d&profile_id=164&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"720","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/261456057.hd.mp4?s=f4f39737df5c4b4c73f6fe6bc0e64ff7c67eae65&profile_id=174&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"1080","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/261456057.hd.mp4?s=f4f39737df5c4b4c73f6fe6bc0e64ff7c67eae65&profile_id=175&oauth2_token_id=911185232"}],"videoSource":"VIMEO","videoTopic":"","videoAccessibility":""},"otherVideos":[{"videoTitle":"Discover Cape Town and surroundings","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"OrwU81DIP7U","sizes":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OrwU81DIP7U?loop=0&rel=0"}],"videoSource":"YOUTUBE","videoTopic":"Insight video","videoAccessibility":"","videoImageUrl":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/CPT/video/CPT-video-1_1-1024x1024.jpg"}],"map":{"introduction":"","mapTitle":"Our selection of must-see places in and around Cape Town","mapId":"https://api.getwemap.com/customers/tbaf/points?destination=CPT&language=en&market=FR","mapUrl":"https://objects.airfrance.com/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/CPT/map/CPT-map.jpeg","mapTopic":"Discovery map","mapSource":"0","mapAccessibility":""},"seoData":{"seoTitle":"Enchanting Cape Town -

The Zeitz, Museum of Contemporary Art Africa, took up residence in a decommissioned grain silo built in the 1920s. The redevelopment was conceived by renowned architect Thomas Heatherwick to emulate London's Tate Modern, established in a former power plant. A luminous atrium has been sculpted out of the silo's cylinders to welcome visitors. About a hundred art galleries spread over nine floors include for most part philanthropist Jochen Zeitz's collection, after who the museum was named. However, the masterpiece seems to be the building itself, with its neo-industrial look and kaleidoscopic picture windows, similar to the shape of a jewel.

It is customary to tip between 10 and 15 percent of the bill in restaurants and bars. Parking facilities are usually monitored by attendants. The latter often ask if you would like them to keep an eye on your car. If you accept, be sure to leave a few rands as a tip, depending on how long your vehicle has been parked.</p>"},"travelGuide":{"isTravelGuideAvailable":false}}}
