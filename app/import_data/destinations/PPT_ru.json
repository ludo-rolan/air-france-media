The secret to this success is undoubtedly its irrefutable simplicity: a single five-course menu that changes on the first Friday of every month.

Paul Gauguin and Jacques Brel, who both rest for eternity in the cemetery of Atuona, passed the end of their life in Hiva Oa, finding inspiration here for their latest creations.</p>\n<p>\"Due to a lack of wind, time stops in the Marquesas\", wrote Brel, a beautiful metaphor for the unique and magical atmosphere of the island, whose steep peaks and cliffs, large bays, and valleys never fail to impress travellers. Artisans here continue the tradition of <em>tiki</em> making - human-shaped sculptures carved in stone, wood or coral. Iipona has the biggest in all of Polynesia. While at Taaoa, under the tropical almond, Tahitian chestnut and banyan trees, other cultural and religious relics can be admired, in the imposing shadow of the 1,300-metre-high Mount Temetiu.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tahititourisme.uk/en-gb/islands-of-tahiti/marquesas-islands-holiday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://tahititourisme.uk/en-gb/islands-of-tahiti/marquesas-islands-holiday/</a></p>","moreInfo":[{"geoCoordinates":{"longitude":"139°0'34.294\"W","latitude":"9°46'16.507\"S"}}]}]}}],"articlesSort":{"ALL":["204890","206600","198304","198300","198302","199041","156667","156657","107443","66008","65852","65939","66011","66698","65589","66771","65496","66052","65436","65665","66653","65882","66230","65809","65908","65520","65509","65758","65684","65551","65815","65554","65428","65759","65986","65352","65662","65444","65940","65452","65723"],"RECENT_NEWS":[],"UNCATEGORIZED":[],"activity":["206600","198304","198300","198302","107443","65589","65496","65436","65665","65520","65758","65684","65551","65554","65428","65759","65352","65662","65444","65452","65723"],"Gastronomy":["204890","199041","156657","66698","66771","66653","66230","65509","65986"],"Hotel":["156667","66008","65852","65939","66011","66052","65882","65809","65908","65815","65940"]},"desktopSettings":{"initialNumber":5,"paginationNumber":10},"mobileSettings":{"initialNumber":15,"paginationNumber":20},"priceCurrency":{"code":"EUR","symbol":"&euro;"},"practicalInfos":{"origin":{"code":"PPT","label":"Таити","canonicalName":"taiti"},"destination":{"code":"PAR","label":"Париж"},"effectiveFlightDuration":"PT20H30M","spokenLanguages":[{"code":"fr","language":"French"}],"time":{"jetLag":"-11:00","timeZone":"GMT-10:00"},"weather":{"pictogramLabel":"чистое ночное небо","temperature":[{"value":26,"unit":"CELSIUS"}],"pictogramCode":"clear_sky_night","pictogramUrlSvg":"","pictogramUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/media/6E5FFEE4-E7FE-4EBB-BED6077B07C19FD5","description":""},"currency":{"data":{"code":"XPF","label":"Франк тихоокеанских владений Франции","rate":119.33,"symbol":"XPF"}},"travelGuide":{"isTravelGuideAvailable":false}}}
