Life can be heard in the rustle of the waves, in the song of the gulls, or seen in the undulations of its hills. This town anchored on the Pacific coast is ‘subliminally' seismic, in perpetual motion. The earthquake that partly destroyed the city in 1906 has been reproduced multiple times, figuratively, with the city making waves that radiate across the planet. Many movements that have put Western societies in tumult were born in its bay. San Francisco started the hippie movement, introduced the New Age, and is giving birth to new technologies as we speak. The city is opening new doors in its commitment to sustainable development and ecology. Brains in Silicon Valley are busy imagining a better world, a fully green world.<br />\nAll this would have seduced Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, whose heirs have made vegetarianism a lifestyle as modern and urban as digital start-ups. In Oshkosh overalls and plaid shirts, you will recognize the new-world adventurers in the hip parts of town. No area in the US has as many small organic farms. San Francisco inspires new culinary trends; its restaurants become models even for major chefs. Nowadays one guru, food journalist and Berkeley grad Michael Pollan, summarises the current ‘forward-looking' food trend as a return to the past: ‘Do not eat anything your grandmother wouldn't recognise as food', he has said.<br />\nDirty Harry, Vertigo, Bullitt—San Francisco has been the scene of many a movie set. Its iconic tramways and disparate neighbourhoods are themselves the ‘stars' of films so well known you will have the impression you too are walking across the screen.<br />\nThe highways that lead you out of the city take you towards landscapes so beautiful, so wild, they make all dreams seem possible on this pristine preserved coastline so rock solid no storm can overwhelm it. Indeed, here is a place that lends itself to the discovery of the work of the first environmentalist poet Henry David Thoreau and of his follower, John Muir, who helped protect the Sierra Nevada mountains just inland. When you're perfectly comfortable in a small cove with a view of sea lions and seals languidly lazing about, pick up your copy of Walden. The ocean here regenerates you, relieving you of your bad vibes. No body of water bears its name so well. Looking out over the Pacific, you will feel invaded by peace.</p>","paragraph":[{"title":"","text":""}],"slideShow":{"topic":"","title":"","pictures":[{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-SFO-2","imageAccessibility":"San Francisco 2"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-SFO-3","imageAccessibility":"San Francisco 3"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-SFO-4","imageAccessibility":"San Francisco 4"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-SFO-5","imageAccessibility":"San Francisco 5"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-SFO-6","imageAccessibility":"San Francisco 6"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-SFO-7","imageAccessibility":"San Francisco 7"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-SFO-8","imageAccessibility":"San Francisco 8"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-SFO-9","imageAccessibility":"San Francisco 9"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-SFO-10","imageAccessibility":"San Francisco 10"}]},"mainVideo":{"videoTitle":"","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"144350621","sizes":[{"height":"360","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/144350621.sd.mp4?s=b04ff43ffac5a5ceaf30cf3da73032d527d04afb&profile_id=112&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"720","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/144350621.hd.mp4?s=d4c5d2d157fa001020e500a0abf8cddc3d11af5c&profile_id=113&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"1080","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/144350621.hd.mp4?s=d4c5d2d157fa001020e500a0abf8cddc3d11af5c&profile_id=119&oauth2_token_id=911185232"}],"videoSource":"VIMEO","videoTopic":"","videoAccessibility":""},"otherVideos":[{"videoTitle":"Discover San Francisco and surroundings","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"FOeeLLT6N80","sizes":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FOeeLLT6N80?loop=0&rel=0"}],"videoSource":"YOUTUBE","videoTopic":"Insight video","videoAccessibility":"","videoImageUrl":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/SFO/video/SFO-video-1_1-1024x1024.jpg"}],"map":{"introduction":"","mapTitle":"Our selection of must-see places in and around San Francisco","mapId":"https://api.getwemap.com/customers/tbaf/points?destination=SFO&language=en&market=FR","mapUrl":"https://objects.airfrance.com/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/SFO/map/SFO-map.jpeg","mapTopic":"Discovery map","mapSource":"0","mapAccessibility":""},"seoData":{"seoTitle":"Travel Guide San Francisco  - Plan your trip to San Francisco with Air France Travel Guide","seoDescription":"Stay in San Francisco: what to visit to San Francisco, where to stay, which restaurant to go?
