Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, born in Albi, was the direct descendant of the Counts of Toulouse and was raised here. Aristocratic, whimsical, and small in stature due to a genetic disease, the painter made this last quality an asset. After his death (at age 37), his family bequeathed many paintings to his hometown, including his various portraits of artist Yvette Guilbert.</p>\n<p>While you are here, we suggest you try the delicious recipes of L'Épicurien, one of Albi's finest tables, which features its own organic bread, fresh seasonal ingredients, and a savvy, well-conceived menu.</p>\n<p><strong>Musée Toulouse-Lautrec</strong><br />\nPalais de la Berbie<br />\nPlace Sainte-Cécile<br />\n81000 Albi<br />\n+33 (0)5 63 49 48 70<br />\n<a href=\"https://musee-toulouse-lautrec.com/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://musee-toulouse-lautrec.com/en</a></p>\n<p><strong>L'Epicurien</strong><br />\n42 place Jean-Jaurès<br />\n81000 Albi<br />\n+33 (0)5 63 53 10 70<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.restaurantlepicurien.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.restaurantlepicurien.com/</a></p>","moreInfo":[{"geoCoordinates":{"longitude":"2°8'55.109\"E","latitude":"43°55'30.307\"N"}}]}]}},{"type":"POI","id":"6590","city":"TLS","country":"FR","region":"FRA","filters":[{"code":"ACCOMODATION","label":"Accommodation"}],"topic":"boutique hotel – hot tip","publicationDate":"2016-02-15","isHidden":false,"isPartner":false,"isCrush":false,"content":{"title":"Le Saint-Sernin, a charming nest","introduction":{"small":"Across from the splendid basilica of Saint-Sernin, this intimate and personalised hotel assures a restful stay."},"mainPicture":{"url":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/news/TLS/le-saint-sernin-un-nid-plein-de-charme/TLS-le-saint-sernin-un-nid-plein-de-charme-1_1-1024x1024.jpg","accessibilityDescription":"Le Saint-Sernin, a charming nest"},"paragraphs":[{"text":"<p>If your prime concern is calm and tranquillity, this small hotel renovated on multiple counts since it opened in 1948 and with only 17 rooms is the perfect companion.</p>\n<p>The carefully designed, classic decor referencing the rich artistic Occitan culture of Medieval times in muted tones adorns this establishment, which is situated in the city centre.
