Named a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2007 and \"Best European Destination\" in 2015, the city has shown for some years now that it is unquestionably a showcase for the art of French living. Wandering the cobbled streets will bring you to shopping central on rue Sainte-Catherine, the longest pedestrian street in Europe, stretching over a kilometre; stroll along the walled banks of the Garonne, through the many squares dotted with sidewalk cafés, bars, and restaurants, and stop to taste oysters, a <em>landaise</em> salad, a duck breast accompanied by a fine wine, and of course the traditional <em>cannelé</em> (caramelised custard pastry), the star of Bordeaux delicacies.<br />\nIt is a 'land of contrasts' between vineyards and forest, freshwater and saltwater, blue-grey sky and the silty ochre waves of the river; no longer exactly a river, nor yet the ocean, the estuary surprises and has a mysterious side. Discover this paradoxical universe the port surrounded by land, the countryside in the middle of the sea.<br />\nMeandering through the great vineyard regions offers incomparable vistas, along with an astounding list of world-renowned wines from the Medoc to Saint-Émilion. Pomerol, Pauillac, Saint-Estèphe, Margaux and all the great growths are invitations to travel and visiting vineyards is undoubtedly the best way to better understand the subtleties of what you find in your glass. Bordeaux wines have offered fame and prosperity to the 'Port of the Moon' and are exported worldwide, ensuring an exceptional image of the art of French living. 'Be you drunken', wrote Baudelaire - but if one really knows how to live well, be so in moderation, of course.<br />\nFurther west, the Atlantic surf rolls in with a promising roar, offering a few ocean nirvanas for surfers and seekers of good spots. In alliance with the ocean winds, the sea raises the mountains of sand at the foot of the cultivated Landes pine forest, and then gives birth to a desert, the Dune de Pilat, which breaks all records in terms of size and height. Once past the great fields of sand, you will arrive at Arcachon Bay, an amazing area of inland sea, beaches, oyster parks, and eco-tourism sites with a variety of entries protected by channels. Once there, let yourself be carried away by the rejuvenating benefits of seaside life.</p>","paragraph":[{"title":"","text":""}],"slideShow":{"topic":"","title":"","pictures":[{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-BOD-2","imageAccessibility":"Bordeaux 2"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-BOD-3","imageAccessibility":"Bordeaux 3"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-BOD-4","imageAccessibility":"Bordeaux 4"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-BOD-5","imageAccessibility":"Bordeaux 5"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-BOD-6","imageAccessibility":"Bordeaux 6"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-BOD-7","imageAccessibility":"Bordeaux 7"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-BOD-8","imageAccessibility":"Bordeaux 8"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-BOD-9","imageAccessibility":"Bordeaux 9"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-BOD-10","imageAccessibility":"Bordeaux 10"}]},"mainVideo":{"videoTitle":"","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"152547728","sizes":[{"height":"360","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/152547728.sd.mp4?s=cf5a7b98191d39360587766d55ba15831af305c9&profile_id=112&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"720","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/152547728.hd.mp4?s=b31a1a08d159d1c09292dd5a46b2966872a16e92&profile_id=113&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"1080","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/152547728.hd.mp4?s=b31a1a08d159d1c09292dd5a46b2966872a16e92&profile_id=119&oauth2_token_id=911185232"}],"videoSource":"VIMEO","videoTopic":"","videoAccessibility":""},"otherVideos":[{"videoTitle":"Discover Bordeaux and surroundings","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"vTQHi7Zg4EQ","sizes":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vTQHi7Zg4EQ?loop=0&rel=0"}],"videoSource":"YOUTUBE","videoTopic":"Insight video","videoAccessibility":"","videoImageUrl":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/BOD/video/BOD-video-1_1-1024x1024.jpg"}],"map":{"introduction":"","mapTitle":"Our selection of must-see places in and around Bordeaux","mapId":"https://api.getwemap.com/customers/tbaf/points?destination=BOD&language=en&market=FR","mapUrl":"https://objects.airfrance.com/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/BOD/map/BOD-map.jpeg","mapTopic":"Discovery map","mapSource":"0","mapAccessibility":""},"seoData":{"seoTitle":"Bordeaux, region of sand and water, land of wine and pine -

Only 40 kilometres from Bordeaux, the city is carved like a jewel set amidst the vineyards; its streets of heavy paving stones plunge passers-by into a reverie of yore. Majestic spires soar upward, golden blond facades at dusk draw the eye, well-arranged shops and animated terraces extend their welcomes to passing tourists. The Tour du Roy and its dungeon are charged with mystery, and the cloister of the Collegiate Church resonates with the past. The panoramic view from the bell tower of the monolithic church is unparalleled, offering an overview of this bucolic landscape and the intimate details of the town itself. Take a stroll along the two-kilometre length of the walls from the Porte Brunet and explore the vineyards with friends, as a couple, with family, on foot or by bike.</p>\n<p><strong>Office de Tourisme du Grand Saint-Émilionnais</strong><br />\nLe Doyenné - Place des Créneaux<br />\n33330 Saint-Émilion</p>\n<p>+33 (0)5 57 55 28 28</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.saint-emilion-tourisme.com/uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.saint-emilion-tourisme.com/uk/</a></p>","moreInfo":[{"geoCoordinates":{"longitude":"0°9'23.483\"W","latitude":"44°53'37.249\"N"}}]}]}},{"type":"POI","id":"2812","city":"BOD","country":"FR","region":"FRA","filters":[{"code":"MUST_SEE","label":"Must See"}],"topic":"shopping","publicationDate":"2016-02-13","isHidden":false,"isPartner":false,"isCrush":false,"content":{"title":"Sainte-Catherine, the longest pedestrian street in Europe","introduction":{"small":"In the midst of downtown, Sainte-Catherine Street was pedestrianised in 1977 and is now the longest shopping street in Europe, stretching over more than a kilometre."},"mainPicture":{"url":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/news/BOD/sainte-catherine-la-plus-longue-rue-pietonne-d-europe-s-offre-une-promenade/BOD-sainte-catherine-la-plus-longue-rue-pietonne-d-europe-s-offre-une-promenade-1_1-1024x1024.jpg","accessibilityDescription":"Sainte-Catherine, the longest pedestrian street in Europe"},"paragraphs":[{"text":"<p>It is almost impossible to speak of Bordeaux, or to walk around it, without mentioning this street, highly popular with the Bordelais who came to do their shopping with their families on the weekends or with friends during the week.
