Milan has been Roman, Lombard, French, Spanish, and Austrian, making it the most European of the Italian cities, and the most open to the future. Is it because it is the backbone of the Italian economy, its financial centre, the seat of the stock market? In Milan, churches sit next to skyscrapers, museums next to design showrooms, and an aria from La Scala may follow a soundtrack from a fashion show.<br />\nMilan is organised in a spiral. In the centre there is the Duomo, La Scala, and the Fashion Quadrangle. Here, in the cafés and boutiques, is where you breathe in the Milanese elegance and savoir-faire Stendhal loved so much. You can taste it in the panettone and the delicious Christmas cakes in the pastry shops. And, as you move away from the centre and closer to Brera and Porto Nuova, you discover a city that is aesthetic, creative, experimental, and environmental. Which would probably not displease one of the city's most cherished citizens, Leonardo da Vinci, if he were somehow alive today.<br />\nThis is also where one finds Michelin-starred gastronomic cooking: Lombard cuisine boasts a young generation of chefs who are reinventing their native cuisine while remaining faithful to its roots.
