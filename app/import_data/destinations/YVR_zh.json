Dynamic, multicultural, green, sophisticated, gourmet, sporty, and easy-going, its qualities are manifold.</em></p>\n<p>Vancouver might be likened a little to California. In summer, the scorching sun radiates off the huge glass towers facing the Pacific Ocean, drawing a perfect skyline. In the background of this tableau, the mountains rise in the distance and yet are easily accessible. Grouse, Cypress, and Seymour mountains, playgrounds for sports or summer hikes, are great for skiing in winter, and one can contemplate their heights from so many points in the city without ever growing tired of the view. The best vantage points are in Stanley Park, Vancouver's emblematic downtown green space on the sea, where colourful totem poles proudly recall British Columbia's First Nations roots.</p>\n<p>The Vancouver ‘way of life' has everything we love about the West Coast. It is relaxed, laid-back, and phlegmatic, a life lived in the moment where the body and mind are one. Vancouverites live in a unique and valuable setting, an eco-urban paradise that for several years has continued to rise in the hit parade of best cities in which to live. Dynamic and particularly young, Vancouver attracts the curious and the cosmopolitan from around the world. There are nearly 70 nationalities represented, though the Asian influence is predominant to a very large degree.</p>\n<p>Its hip neighbourhoods, dotted with coffee shops and trendy art galleries, are models of ecological commitment. In Vancouver, people live in harmony with nature. Sports are everywhere and it is not unusual to see a surfer and businessman a few metres from one another. Yoga on the beach in Kitsilano, paddling in False Creek, a boat trip along the shores of the Pacific, or canoeing in the North Shore—recreational activities abound. And as in all cities with beaches, there is a holiday feeling throughout the year.</p>\n<p>The city is easily discovered by bicycle. Many hotels lend them, allowing you a tremendously exhilarating sense of freedom. The more adventurous will choose a floatplane to experience the richness of the city and its proximity to boreal forests. Just 40 minutes by car outside the city, British Columbia's conifers extend for as far as the eye can see. Its rivers and waterfalls invite you to travel even farther to admire the snowy peaks of Whistler, one of the world's great ski resorts.</p>","paragraph":[{"title":"","text":""}],"slideShow":{"topic":"","title":"","pictures":[{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-YVR-2","imageAccessibility":"Vancouver 2"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-YVR-3","imageAccessibility":"Vancouver 3"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-YVR-4","imageAccessibility":"Vancouver 4"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-YVR-5","imageAccessibility":"Vancouver 5"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-YVR-6","imageAccessibility":"Vancouver 6"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-YVR-7","imageAccessibility":"Vancouver 7"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-YVR-8","imageAccessibility":"Vancouver 8"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-YVR-9","imageAccessibility":"Vancouver 9"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-YVR-10","imageAccessibility":"Vancouver 10"}]},"mainVideo":{"videoTitle":"","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"157010225","sizes":[{"height":"360","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/157010225.sd.mp4?s=7cc9be94bd3bd4d2e7922059ef9293bc7390ca43&profile_id=164&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"720","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/157010225.hd.mp4?s=7200bee36ea86e6c9c5156f9f43d79f813ed38ed&profile_id=113&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"1080","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/157010225.hd.mp4?s=7200bee36ea86e6c9c5156f9f43d79f813ed38ed&profile_id=119&oauth2_token_id=911185232"}],"videoSource":"VIMEO","videoTopic":"","videoAccessibility":""},"otherVideos":[{"videoTitle":"Discover Vancouver and surroundings","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"T_k4YjYcReo","sizes":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/T_k4YjYcReo?loop=0&rel=0"}],"videoSource":"YOUTUBE","videoTopic":"Insight video","videoAccessibility":"","videoImageUrl":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/YVR/video/YVR-video-1_1-1024x1024.jpg"}],"map":{"introduction":"","mapTitle":"Our selection of must-see places in and around Vancouver","mapId":"https://api.getwemap.com/customers/tbaf/points?destination=YVR&language=en&market=FR","mapUrl":"https://objects.airfrance.com/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/YVR/map/YVR-map.jpeg","mapTopic":"Discovery map","mapSource":"0","mapAccessibility":""},"seoData":{"seoTitle":"Travel Guide Vancouver  - Plan your trip to Vancouver with Air France Travel Guide","seoDescription":"Stay in Vancouver: what to visit to Vancouver, where to stay, which restaurant to go?

Or maybe because of its oceanic climate, conducive to a gentle pace of life? Whatever it is, the fact remains that this city is particularly well-suited for a romantic getaway.</p>\n<p>Your love nest is called the Wedgewood Hotel. The foyer, all light wood panelling and stunning floral arrangements, sets the tone: here, charm and elegance reign supreme without sacrificing any comforts. Looking around, there is no doubt that you have come to one of the prestigious Relais &amp; Châteaux hotels. Your room marries warm shades from beige to chocolate with quilted fabrics and curtains inspired by a bygone age. Book a suite on the top floor: you will be treated to a view over Robson Square, one of Vancouver's iconic landmarks.</p>\n<p>The frozen body of water below gives you an idea of something romantic you can do together: ice skating under a pretty glass dome in the heart of the city. A few metres away stands the former courthouse, characterised by its neo-classical architecture. Since 1931, it has been home to Vancouver Art Gallery. Inside, you will discover 157 works by Emily Carr, one of the most famous Canadian artists in the world. Her paintings reconstruct local landscapes using original graphics which borrow from the calligraphy and traditional art of the indigenous people of North America. As you gaze at paintings of these vast natural spaces, you are overcome by a feeling of sweet melancholy.</p>\n<p>When you get back to your hotel, you pay a visit to the spa, which also offers a couple's massage. Choose the Swedish massage using hot stones for deep tissue relaxation. Afterwards, you make your way to Bacchus, the hotel's restaurant, with its delightfully cosy ambience. The menu offers its own take on European cuisine: the beef tartare with ginger and soya or the chicken <em>blanquette</em> poached in butter and served with garlic potatoes and smoked Tyrolian bacon are a treat for your taste buds.</p>\n<p><strong>Wedgewood Hotel &amp; Spa Vancouver<br />\n</strong>845 Hornby St<br />\nVancouver BC V6Z 1V1<br />\nCanada<br />\n+1 800 663 0666<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.wedgewoodhotel.com/?utm_source=GoogleMapsWW&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_content=Businesslisting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.wedgewoodhotel.com</a></p>\n<p><strong>Robson Square Ice Rink<br />\n</strong>800 Robson St<br />\nVancouver BC V6Z 3B7<br />\nCanada<br />\n+1 604 646 3554<br />\n<a style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"http://www.robsonsquare.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.robsonsquare.com/</a></p>\n<p><strong>Vancouver Art Gallery<br />\n</strong>750 Hornby St<br />\nVancouver BC V6Z 2H7<br />\nCanada<br />\n+1 604 662 4700<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.vanartgallery.bc.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.vanartgallery.bc.ca/</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>","picture":{"url":"https://img.static-af.com/images/media/4CC40182-3D67-44F0-991FDC5F3452A020/"}},{"text":"<p><strong>A romantic stroll or two</strong></p>\n<p>Next day, you decide to go and hang a small padlock on the Love Locks sculpture in Queen Elizabeth Park, located less than ten minutes from the Wedgewood Hotel by taxi. Unveiled in 2016, it represents a couple embracing. The metal wire structure was designed so that these small symbols of love can easily be attached to it.</p>\n<p>You continue your romantic itinerary by taking a cookery class for two at the Dirty Apron Cooking School, famous throughout Vancouver. It is up to you whether you choose the vegetarian menu or the Asian-inspired menu, honouring the city's large Chinese community. Professional chefs will guide you step by step as you cook a starter, a main course and a dessert which you then sit down to eat with your friends for the day around a big light-wood table in a friendly setting.</p>\n<p>After your culinary masterclass, head to <a href=\"../../common/travel-guide/explore-stanley-park-by-bike.htm\">Stanley Park</a>, a vast green expanse that stretches out into the waters of Burrard Inlet. To discover some or all of its 400 hectares of nature, hire a bike from one of the many rental stations. Cycle out to the rose garden along the park's network of cycle tracks. With some 3,500 red, yellow and orange rose bushes, the place is simply enchanting. Take a stroll under the wooden arbour and breathe in the intoxicating perfume that the climbing flowers give off. Extend your walk a bit further by passing through the more hidden rhododendron garden. To get back to the city centre, you walk along the coast from where you can watch a blazing sunset over English Bay. The meeting of the sky's warm tones and the immense blue of the Pacific Ocean will remain engraved in your memory forever.</p>\n<p><strong>Queen Elizabeth Park</strong><br />\n4600 Cambie St<br />\nVancouver BC V5Z 2Z1<br />\nCanada<br />\n+1 604 873 7000<br />\n<a href=\"https://vancouver.ca/parks-recreation-culture/queen-elizabeth-park.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://vancouver.ca/parks-recreation-culture/queen-elizabeth-park.aspx</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Dirty Apron Cooking School</strong><br />\n540 Beatty St,<br />\nVancouver BC V6B 2L3<br />\nCanada<br />\n+1 604 879 8588<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.dirtyapron.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.dirtyapron.com/</a></p>\n<p><strong>Stanley Park </strong><br />\n1950-1970 W Georgia Street<br />\nVancouver BC V6G 1Z4<br />\nCanada<br />\n+1 604 681 6728<br />\n<a href=\"../../common/travel-guide/explore-stanley-park-by-bike.htm\">https://www.airfrance.com/FR/en/common/travel-guide/explore-stanley-park-by-bike.htm</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>","picture":{"url":"https://img.static-af.com/images/media/D4E72218-386F-43E1-ADC943E15A0F5881/"}},{"text":"<p><strong>A day trip to Victoria </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"../../common/travel-guide/visit-elegant-victoria-bc-s-capital-on-vancouver-island.htm\">Victoria</a>, the charming capital of British Columbia, is well worth a day trip. Sitting at the southern tip of Vancouver Island, you can get there by taking a 90-minute ferry ride across the Strait of Georgia with its string of little islands where it is not uncommon to see seals. Several flights by seaplane also make the connection. If you come by boat, get off at Fisherman's Wharf with pretty, colourful floating homes lining the quayside. As you take a stroll along the waterfront promenade, a queue of people outside an upcycled shipping container catches your eye. You have arrived at Red Fish Blue Fish. The wait is certainly worth it as the brand is renowned for its excellent, sustainable fish and seafood. The fish and chips are superb, but if you are tempted, try their tacos topped with fresh grilled oysters - truly scrumptious!</p>\n<p>Behind the port, you will see other districts of the city with their Victorian architecture, a leftover from the city's colonial past. Lose yourself in the picturesque alleys of the historic centre. When you reach Market Square, you will appreciate the tranquillity that emanates from the red-brick buildings. These former saloons are now home to designer boutiques and art galleries. It takes 30 minutes to walk to the city's architectural landmark, Craigdarroch Castle. The castle looks like a Baroque Scottish manor house and just seeing it, perched on the hilltop, fills you with romantic daydreams. Climb its 87 steps and you will be rewarded with stunning views over the city and port.</p>\n<p>It is soon time to head back to the port for your return ferry journey. Already feeling a bit nostalgic about the day, you stop off at the glorious tea room at the Fairmont Empress Hotel, all decked out in golds and velvet. You feel a bit like royalty as you sip your tea from a pretty, Chinese porcelain cup, a perfect reproduction of the tea service that Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, gave to city officials on a visit in 1939. If you want to enjoy this exceptional place, we strongly recommend that you book ahead. Elegance is the order of the day here, so make sure you dress appropriately. As you board the boat back to Vancouver, your heart is full of tender memories.</p>\n<p><strong>Red Fish Blue Fish</strong><br />\n1006 Wharf St<br />\nVictoria BC V8W 1N8<br />\nCanada<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.redfish-bluefish.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.redfish-bluefish.com/</a></p>\n<p><strong>Market Square </strong><br />\n560 Johnson St<br />\nVictoria BC V8W 3C6<br />\nCanada<br />\n+1 250 386 2441<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.marketsquare.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.marketsquare.ca/</a></p>\n<p><strong>Craigdarroch Castle </strong><br />\n1050 Joan Crescent<br />\nVictoria BC V8S 3L5<br />\nCanada<br />\n+1 250 592 5323<br />\n<a href=\"https://thecastle.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://thecastle.ca/</a></p>\n<p><strong>Fairmont Empress Hotel </strong><br />\n721 Government St<br />\nVictoria BC V8W 1W5<br />\nCanada<br />\n+1  250 389 2727<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.teaattheempress.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.teaattheempress.com/</a></p>","picture":{"url":"https://img.static-af.com/images/media/16C1A695-DBBF-49A5-AA12B57E2302488D/"}}]}},{"type":"POI","id":"155312","city":"YVR","country":"CA","region":"AME","filters":[{"code":"GOURMET_ADVENTURES","label":"Food and Drink"},{"code":"OUTTINGS","label":"Going out"}],"topic":"hot tip - bar","publicationDate":"2018-12-18","isHidden":false,"isPartner":false,"isCrush":false,"content":{"title":"Gringo, a taco-cocktail winning combination","introduction":{"small":"As a hybrid place between a Mexican cantina and a Latino bar, Gringo offers DIY tacos best enjoyed with a beer or a cocktail."},"mainPicture":{"url":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/news/YVR/gringo-la-combinaison-gagnante-tacos-cocktail/YVR-gringo-la-combinaison-gagnante-tacos-cocktail-1_1-1024x1024.jpg","accessibilityDescription":"Gringo, a taco-cocktail winning combination"},"paragraphs":[{"text":"<p>In Vancouver's historical Gastown neighbourhood, Gringo gets off the beaten track.
