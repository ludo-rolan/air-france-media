In the meantime, the cinema industry – globally known as Bollywood, is nowadays the most prolific in the world.<br />\nWhether by foot, taxi or on board a double-decker bus, explore Marina Drive, its old colonial-style houses and cricket games on the grass. Pack up colours and scents at the huge Crawford Market, at the centre of which you will find a surprising fountain. Get away to the Malabar Hill district, filled with sacred temples and historical parks. Immerse yourself in Mahatma Gandhi's intimacy at the house-museum that bears his name.
