It has gone from neo-Gothic to Gothic with a slight Baroque influence.</p>\n<p>Its 136 spires and 3,500 statues have earned it its affectionate nickname, 'the marble hedgehog'. Its interior is just as beautiful, thanks to the crucifix by Leonardo da Vinci.</p>\n<p>Do not miss the Duomo's terraces, as they bring out the promise of an unusual stroll between artistic details and a panoramic view of Milan.

(Petit) also has an older brother-(Petit) in Miami. Located in the Porta Nuova neighbourhood, (Petit) breaks the code of alpine restaurants with its decor. The tables and chairs are of Parisian inspiration, while the mirrors and pale colours are Scandinavian. At night, the room is illuminated by more than a hundred chandeliers, candles, and candelabras, which give the space a cosy and romantic atmosphere. The Milanese love it... The other part of the restaurant houses a grocery and a real Italian <em>mamma</em>-style trattoria. The sausages are hung on the wall, the hams are enthroned beside the slicing machine, and at your table, the menu offers a variety of homemade dishes that satisfy all appetites. Try, among others, the fresh salmon carpaccio and, for dessert, the tiramisu, a speciality of nearby Piedmont. The octopus salad with potatoes, tomatoes and olives, and the tuna steak served with pistachios and mashed Jerusalem artichoke nicely complement the menu.</p>\n<p><strong>(Petit) Milano</strong><br />\nVia Amerigo Vespucci 5<br />\n20124 Milano</p>\n<p>+39 02 8969 0870</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.petitbistrogroup.com/milano\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.petitbistrogroup.com/milano</a></p>\n<p>Menu: around 35 EUR</p>","moreInfo":[{"geoCoordinates":{"longitude":"9°11'34.031\"E","latitude":"45°28'51.763\"N"}}]}]}}],"articlesSort":{"ALL":["201019","201025","156356","156343","107216","107214","1320","1225","1231","1288","1169","1206","1149","1160","1241","1180","1304","1296","1282","1215","1315","1258","1250","1271","1194","1309"],"RECENT_NEWS":[],"UNCATEGORIZED":[],"activity":["107216","107214","1225","1231","1169","1206","1149","1160","1241","1180","1215","1194"],"Gastronomy":["201019","201025","156356","156343","1320","1304","1296","1315","1309"],"Hotel":["1288","1282","1258","1250","1271"]},"desktopSettings":{"initialNumber":5,"paginationNumber":10},"mobileSettings":{"initialNumber":15,"paginationNumber":20},"priceCurrency":{"code":"EUR","symbol":"&euro;"},"practicalInfos":{"origin":{"code":"MIL","label":"Милан","canonicalName":"milan"},"destination":{"code":"PAR","label":"Париж"},"effectiveFlightDuration":"PT1H25M","spokenLanguages":[{"code":"it","language":"Italian"}],"time":{"jetLag":"+00:00","timeZone":"GMT+01:00"},"weather":{"pictogramLabel":"ясно","temperature":[{"value":12,"unit":"CELSIUS"}],"pictogramCode":"sunny","pictogramUrlSvg":"","pictogramUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/media/09421D21-1365-4662-950D2E658231FA20","description":""},"currency":{"data":{"code":"EUR","label":"Евро","rate":1,"symbol":"&#8364;"}},"travelGuide":{"isTravelGuideAvailable":false}}}
