But sometimes we all need to get away from the hustle and bustle around us and escape in search of tranquillity. In Abidjan, nature lovers can recharge their batteries in Banco National Park, an expansive green space and hydraulic reservoir in the city. Bordering the city's northern motorway, the park's 3,500 hectares of primary forest are home to a number of specimens of chimpanzees, dwarf antelopes, birds and butterflies. It might surprise you to know that, along with Rio de Janeiro, Abidjan is the only metropolis in the world where a true virgin forest flourishes.</p>\n<p>Further east, less than 20 km from the city centre, you can relax in the centuries-old Bingerville Botanical Garden, which has been classified as a historical monument since 1991. Initially a scientific laboratory in its capacity as a test garden, when cultivating cocoa, coffee and palm plants was first introduced to Ivory Coast, it now showcases the thriving Ivorian ecosystem. With its pathways also accessible to cyclists, the Botanical Garden is the perfect place for families in search of calm and rejuvenation.</p>\n<p><strong>Banco National Park</strong><br />\nAbidjan<br />\n+225 22 41 40 59</p>\n<p><strong>Bingerville Botanical Garden</strong><br />\nBingerville<br />\n+225 48 22 70 98</p>"}]}},{"type":"POI","id":"194973","city":"ABJ","country":"CI","region":"AFR","filters":[{"code":"MUST_SEE","label":"Must See"},{"code":"ARTS_AND_CULTURE","label":"Art and Culture"}],"topic":"art galleries","publicationDate":"2020-01-24","isHidden":false,"isPartner":false,"isCrush":false,"content":{"title":"Galleries galore","introduction":{"small":"Abidjan's cultural scene is bursting at the seams with art galleries, each more remarkable than the last.

Houkami Guyzagn promotes young visual artists from Ivory Coast and organises regular openings, conferences and “art and drinks” sessions with the aim of making this place a unique space for meetings and exchanges. At the M'Pataô gallery, 1,200 sqm of space houses more than 1,600 exceptional pieces of traditional and ethnic art to help you discover the rich diversity of Africa's cultural heritage. Finally, Fondation Charles Donwahi advocates a love of the arts without borders: sculptures, paintings, graffiti, photographs, short and feature-length films; the artistic programming here boasts eclecticism and subjectivity.
