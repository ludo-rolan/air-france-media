The pride of the Renaissance, you simply need to visit Old Lyon to get a feel for all the city's multicultural inspirations.<br />\nStroll around, lose yourself in the <em>traboules</em> and alleyways of the Croix-Rousse, and, for a moment, imagine the swirling rhythms of the weaving of Lyon's silk workers, the famous <em>canuts</em>. Take a moment to appreciate the legendary banter of the traditional puppet 'Guignol', created in around 1808 by Laurent Mourguet, and smell the mouth-watering aromas wafting from the kitchens of 'Lyon's Mothers'.<br />\nThis is Lyon… With its <em>bouchons</em> (the traditional Lyonnais restaurants), brasseries, and Michelin-starred restaurants, Lyon is the capital of French gastronomy, and its many chefs shine in the haute cuisine hall of fame. The <em>Bocuse d'Or</em> - paying tribute to chef Paul Bocuse, its most illustrious ambassador who passed away in January 2018 - acknowledges these chefs' culinary expertise throughout the world.<br />\nBut this captivating city has many other equally refined and exceptional facets. Over the seasons, artistic biennales and festivals are linked: contemporary dance performances flirt with rock concerts, while the arts are on display at the Confluences Museum. During the summer, the stars twinkle for the Fourvière Nights concerts, and in winter, the Festival of Lights illuminates the night sky, setting Lyon's monuments ablaze with a thousand sparkles. The creative spirit of the Left Bank is more alive than ever on the walls of buildings adorned with monumental frescoes illustrating the past and contemporary history of the city. As the host city for the a number of football matches in the upcoming 2024 Summer Olympics, Lyon regularly sees top-flight games being played in the Parc Olympique Lyonnais, also known as the Groupama Stadium.<br />\nLyon intoxicates the senses. As night falls, a merry bustle invades the streets, glasses of Beaujolais clink, the hour of the sacrosanct aperitif rings out. Laughter is heard, conversations ignite, and conviviality reigns over every table. Lyon combines exaltation with a good life that you will get to appreciate in any number of ways; by walking along the welcoming banks of the Rhône and Saône, or by going for a picnic in the Tête d'Or Park, and so much more.</p>","paragraph":[{"title":"","text":""}],"slideShow":{"topic":"","title":"","pictures":[{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-LYS-2","imageAccessibility":"Lyon 2"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-LYS-3","imageAccessibility":"Lyon 3"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-LYS-4","imageAccessibility":"Lyon 4"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-LYS-5","imageAccessibility":"Lyon 5"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-LYS-6","imageAccessibility":"Lyon 6"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-LYS-7","imageAccessibility":"Lyon 7"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-LYS-8","imageAccessibility":"Lyon 8"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-LYS-9","imageAccessibility":"Lyon 9"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-LYS-10","imageAccessibility":"Lyon 10"}]},"mainVideo":{"videoTitle":"","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"152543309","sizes":[{"height":"360","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/152543309.sd.mp4?s=3162ba9d464218a5ec1672ecdafa876c135d8afa&profile_id=112&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"720","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/152543309.hd.mp4?s=24a1d5db2c8e78457257acdc8354e1049e998f22&profile_id=113&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"1080","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/152543309.hd.mp4?s=24a1d5db2c8e78457257acdc8354e1049e998f22&profile_id=119&oauth2_token_id=911185232"}],"videoSource":"VIMEO","videoTopic":"","videoAccessibility":""},"otherVideos":[{"videoTitle":"Discover Lyon and surroundings","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"avHZAEroUg4","sizes":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/avHZAEroUg4?loop=0&rel=0"}],"videoSource":"YOUTUBE","videoTopic":"Insight video","videoAccessibility":"","videoImageUrl":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/LYS/video/LYS-video-1_1-1024x1024.jpg"}],"map":{"introduction":"","mapTitle":"Our selection of must-see places in and around Lyon","mapId":"https://api.getwemap.com/customers/tbaf/points?destination=LYS&language=en&market=FR","mapUrl":"https://objects.airfrance.com/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/LYS/map/LYS-map.jpeg","mapTopic":"Discovery map","mapSource":"0","mapAccessibility":""},"seoData":{"seoTitle":"Lyon, the luminous -
