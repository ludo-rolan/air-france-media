On the terraces, the sound of clinking glasses mixes with the call to prayer of the muezzins, and the incessant cacophony caused by honking cars.<br />\nCairo never seems to sleep, never seems to stop living. The nightlife in the Egyptian capital only ends when the sun rises. If dancers and singers have gone home, the underground retains its unlikely places and chic clubs. The day always starts with a brunch and the eternal replay of those old black-and-white movies where Farid al-Atrash is singing. Is it to help prevent us from forgetting the past? Cairo is not a nostalgic city. It seems to bear no grudges nor suffer any pain. It moves forward, sprawling into the desert.</p>\n<p>Each visit brings about a lot of surprises. A brand new neighbourhood has risen up, as well as a new fashion, a restaurant here and a hotel there. The Grand Museum's arrow is each time more inclined towards the Giza pyramids, which still defy time. The traffic is always dense, almost oppressive, yet it is fun to ride with all the windows open in a ‘black and white', the nickname for the ramshackle taxis, to go to dinner for Maadi or Zamalek.
