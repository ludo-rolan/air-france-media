Partly destroyed by fire in 1624, the city was rebuilt, adorning itself from the beginning of the 17<sup>th</sup> century in the most beautiful colours. Located at the entrance of a large fjord, Oslo remains primarily a city turned towards the sea. Surrounded by green hills and dense forests, the capital of Norway is surrounded by numerous easily accessible islands. Far from the stereotypes and constantly moving forward, Oslo amazes with the creativity and cheerfulness of its inhabitants. Though the climate imposes its laws, the fact remains that the daily life of the Osloites charms with its gentleness and liveliness.</p>\n<p>Between Scandinavian design and wilderness excursions, a trip to Oslo will satisfy the desires of everyone. The history of the city may be read in the coloured facades of the district located around the popular Karl Johans Gate. The heart of the city beats here, and over the past several years, numerous museums and galleries have opened their doors.</p>\n<p>Oslo can be visited at any time of year, as its many facets offer a diversity of attractions. It is at once urban, rural, and maritime, donning the white lights of the northern winter to the delight of those looking for the thrill of the great Scandinavian north, while the Norwegians' joie de vivre and the islands of Oslo's Fjords will astound you in summer. You may also explore the Norwegian countryside by taking various trains leaving from Oslo's central station.
