Ride your Vespa and discover Rome, the city of splendours. Nestled among the seven hills that jealously guard it, under the watchful eyes of the stone lions of Piazza del Popolo and the maternal gaze of the Capitoline Wolf, the Eternal City proudly and haughtily flaunts, at every <em>viale</em> and <em>vicoli</em>, and on each of its countless <em>piazzi</em>, its marvellous adornments and enticements. Gardens, galleries, palaces, domes, fountains… each takes us back to the Rome of the Caesars, the Rome of the popes, the Renaissance of the Borgias and the Medicis, the Baroque explosion. Rome, this beautiful, millennia-old grand dame, invites you on a journey through the centuries. Walk with her from the Coliseum to St. Peter's Basilica, through the gardens of the Villa Borghese to the Trevi Fountain. Stroll with her in this open-air museum, where the soft, golden light is reflected in the dappled water of the fountains, over the gleaming statues of Bernini and Michelangelo, and the ancient marble covering ever surface, thousands of years old.<br />\nDon't, however, make the mistake of only seeing Rome as a setting of secular splendours. A scent of <em>dolce vita</em> fills in the air, and you will quickly realise that the heart of a lively Italy beats here, vibrant and festive. Trastevere, the favourite area of trendy urbanites and young fashionable families, delivers on quaint folklore, with laundry drying in windows above small trattorias whose culinary wonders are more often to be found among the daily suggestions than on the written menus. Mixing with the cheerful locals will introduce you to the city's customs and traditions—like its white wine, Lazio. Romans are like their city: fine and delicate in their manners, but sometimes revealing a spicier, sharp-witted and more insolent side. Rome, the mysterious and mesmerising <em>Prima Donna</em>, has more than one trick up its sleeve to charm those who seek to discover her.</p>","paragraph":[{"title":"","text":""}],"slideShow":{"topic":"","title":"","pictures":[{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-ROM-2","imageAccessibility":"Rome 2"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-ROM-3","imageAccessibility":"Rome 3"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-ROM-4","imageAccessibility":"Rome 4"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-ROM-5","imageAccessibility":"Rome 5"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-ROM-6","imageAccessibility":"Rome 6"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-ROM-7","imageAccessibility":"Rome 7"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-ROM-8","imageAccessibility":"Rome 8"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-ROM-9","imageAccessibility":"Rome 9"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-ROM-10","imageAccessibility":"Rome 10"}]},"mainVideo":{"videoTitle":"","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"261456313","sizes":[{"height":"360","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/261456313.sd.mp4?s=ef43c50b0123ac65f8f8a4872c9bf0f8f4905b95&profile_id=164&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"720","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/261456313.hd.mp4?s=1f1df2a6790ea6049393f99d1d32855d8025f82a&profile_id=174&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"1080","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/261456313.hd.mp4?s=1f1df2a6790ea6049393f99d1d32855d8025f82a&profile_id=175&oauth2_token_id=911185232"}],"videoSource":"VIMEO","videoTopic":"","videoAccessibility":""},"otherVideos":[{"videoTitle":"Discover Rome and surroundings","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"IdUJRKasjzI","sizes":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IdUJRKasjzI?loop=0&rel=0"}],"videoSource":"YOUTUBE","videoTopic":"Insight video","videoAccessibility":"","videoImageUrl":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/ROM/video/ROM-video-1_1-1024x1024.jpg"}],"map":{"introduction":"","mapTitle":"Our selection of must-see places in and around Rome","mapId":"https://api.getwemap.com/customers/tbaf/points?destination=ROM&language=en&market=FR","mapUrl":"https://objects.airfrance.com/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/ROM/map/ROM-map.jpeg","mapTopic":"Discovery map","mapSource":"0","mapAccessibility":""},"seoData":{"seoTitle":"Travel Guide Rome  - Plan your trip to Rome with Air France Travel Guide","seoDescription":"Stay in Rome: what to visit to Rome, where to stay, which restaurant to go?

The astonishing Pyramid of Cestius rises in front of you to a height of 37 metres. This tomb was built in honour of a Roman magistrate, at a time when the architecture of Egypt, then part of the Roman Empire, was very much in fashion. It stands in the middle of Rome's English Cemetery, the final resting place of many illustrious figures, including Romantic poet John Keats.

On every street corner, tempting aromas make your mouth water. In days gone by, the reputation of the area's restaurants was built on quality meat from the nearest slaughterhouses.
