The aerial view of Ria Formosa, the vast natural park alongside the east coast, is an opportunity to admire the branching lagoons and salt marshes, the wide expanses of sand separating the wetland from the ocean, and the unique blue-green of the water that ripples between islands, rocks and mainland.</p>\n<p>Once you are on the ground, Faro, “capital” of the Algarve, offers a break full of light and dazzling colour. Tucked away inside its surrounding walls, the old town has the region's entire history packed into it. You can admire the Arco da Vila, the colossal gate that gives onto the seafront, and take time to visit the Capela dos Ossos, with its façades completely covered with bones. Stroll through the historic quarter and enjoy the many museums (such as the Municipal Museum or the Algarve Regional Museum). The town centre displays the gentle art of Portuguese-style living, with glimpses of its modernist architecture, cafés whose terraces spill out onto the esplanades and traditional restaurants offering seafood alongside figs, almonds and lemons, symbols of the entire region. From the roof of Faro's Gothic cathedral, where storks sometimes take up residence, you can enjoy a striking contrast between culture and nature with a view of Ria Formosa and its numerous little islands, not to mention the vast sandy beaches that stretch for miles.</p>\n<p>Having spied it from a distance, it is time to go and become better acquainted with the natural park. The beauty of the scenery might almost fade into the background in the excitement of observing so many indigenous species, some unique to this spot. The Algarve is home to about 30,000 different varieties of bird, including the pink flamingo, the grey plover, the western swamphen and various families of ibis, while its seabeds are the refuge of one of the largest seahorse colonies in the world.</p>\n<p>This coastal region, dominated by the fish and seafood trade, is sprinkled with fishing villages that have retained all their traditional character. Here, the jacarandas lining the roads are bent down under the weight of their scented mauve flowers. Several times a day, a train winds its way along the coast, linking Lagos and Vila Real de Santo António. Taking the train gives you the chance to grasp the essence of the Algarve. The west coast, marked by the era of great discoveries by Portuguese navigators in the 15<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> centuries, reveals a landscape where the ocean torments the cliffs, carves out tunnels in the stone, surges into the sea caves of Ponta da Piedade and breaks its waves on Cape Saint Vincent, the farthest south-western point of mainland Europe. The eastern part of the Algarve, for its part, offers a comprehensive overview of the region's multicultural heritage, which has seen the Romans, Visigoths and Moors each settle here for a time. Tavira, with its architecture typical of southern Portugal, is possibly the city that best expresses this diversity, with its “Roman bridge”, Moorish-inspired buildings, medieval castle and many churches.

Of these, opt for Praia da Barreta, situated on the south coast of Ilha Deserta (“deserted island”), accessible only by boat (15 minutes by shuttle, 45 minutes by ferry). There is only one restaurant on this island, there are not any others. You can enjoy all the peace and quiet of a Robinson Crusoe!

It has to be said that, thanks to the proximity of the ocean, the protection ensured by the Serra de Monchique against the cold airstreams from the north, and the south-facing exposure, the region's climate is perfect for wine-growing. Today, over twenty producers operate between Lagos and Tavira. Planted in an astonishing variety of soils, their vines produce a wide range of grape varieties, such as Arinto, Fernão Pires, Malvasia Fina, Chardonnay and Sauvignon for the whites, Alicante Bouschet, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Trincadeira, Petit Verdot and Touriga Nacional for the reds.</p>\n<p>Visit these <em>quintas</em> (“farms”), such as Quinta do Outeiro, near the town of Silves, to explore the vines and savour the wines of the Algarve. Thanks, in particular, to manual harvesting in 20-kilo containers and eight months' ageing in French casks, Joaquim Lopes has turned his estate into an indisputable leading name that supplies a great many restaurants in the surrounding area.</p>\n<p>When your visit is over, travel on five kilometres to Quinta da Vinha. This farm is distinctive for growing a typical old grape variety, the Negra Mole. This grape yields a light red wine, verging on rosé, which is a perfect match for fish and seafood. Follow your guide through the cellar and vineyard to discover the production process, step by step. Afterwards, you can take a break and enjoy some delicious <em>petiscos</em> (local tapas).</p>\n<p>A few kilometres further on, the Quinta dos Sentidos welcomes you with a guided tour of its vines, production tools and flower garden. When it comes to tasting - in moderation, of course - this is done a little differently here: in addition to wine, you will taste verjuice, the acidic juice that comes from unripe grapes. And even those who are not into oenology will find something to enjoy here. The estate makes an excellent olive oil, one or more bottles of which you can take home in your luggage.

Today, it still has its historic ramparts and, as you walk through its narrow cobbled streets, it reveals many traces of its past. Opposite the marina stands the Arco da Vila (“Arch of the City”), a massive gate officially unveiled in 1812 and designed from the plans of Italian architect Francisco Xavier Fabri (1761-1817). Its structure incorporates the Porta Árabe (“Arab Gate”), dating from the 11<sup>th</sup> century, which once formed part of the old Muslim-era walls and enabled sailors to disembark directly inside the town.</p>\n<p>Just alongside, the Jardim Manuel Bivar is the ideal place for a refreshing break, while 200 m from there, in the direction of the lagoon, is the imposing sight of Faro's superb cathedral. Built in the Gothic style in 1249, it was severely damaged during the earthquake of 1755. A few vestiges of the original do however remain, such as the tower and the large pointed Gothic gate that opens onto the body of the church. After your visit inside this monument, be sure to climb up to its roofs: they afford visitors the best panoramic view of the city and its surroundings.</p>\n<p>Have a look around the Regional Ethnographic Museum of the Algarve, designed to preserve local memory, or the Municipal Museum, installed inside the Convent of Nossa Senhora da Assunção, in the midst of the historic quarter.</p>\n<p>Further to the north is Faro's Church of Our Lady of Carmo, with its sumptuous baroque façade. Richly decorated, it houses carved altars that are unique of their kind. However, the main attraction is situated behind the church, at the end of a garden. Here, you will discover the Capela dos Ossos, a chapel decorated with some thousand or so skeletons that once belonged to monks, abbesses and other dignitaries. The place calls for contemplation of the painstaking work needed to compose this stunning piece of work. The aim of the Franciscan monks, who managed the project in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century, was to draw people's attention to the fleeting nature of life.</p>\n<p><strong>Arco da Vila<br />\n</strong>Rua da Misericórdia 8<br />\n8000-269 Faro<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.visitportugal.com/en/NR/exeres/EA06BA8B-DE87-4F15-9297-94E92745314A\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.visitportugal.com/en/NR/exeres/EA06BA8B-DE87-4F15-9297-94E92745314A </a></p>\n<p><strong>Jardim Manuel Bivar<br />\n</strong>Praça Dom Francisco Gomes 12<br />\n8000-269 Faro</p>\n<p><strong>Cathédrale de Faro<br />\n</strong>Largo da Sé 11<br />\n8000-138 Faro<br />\nTel : +351 89 807 590<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.visitalgarve.pt/en/510/igreja-da-se-de-faro-cathedrale.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.visitalgarve.pt/en/510/igreja-da-se-de-faro-cathedrale.aspx</a></p>\n<p><strong>Musée ethnographique</strong> <strong>régional de l'Algarve<br />\n</strong>Praça da Liberdade 2<br />\n8000-329 Faro<br />\nTel : +351 289 870 893</p>\n<p><strong>Musée municipal de Faro<br />\n</strong>Largo Dom Afonso III 14<br />\n8000-167 Faro<br />\nTel : +351 289 870 829<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/museumunicipaldefaro/?ref=page_internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/museumunicipaldefaro/?ref=page_internal</a></p>\n<p><strong>Église du carmel et Capela dos Ossos<br />\n</strong>Largo do Carmo<br />\n8000-148 Faro<br />\nTel : +351 289 824 490<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.visitalgarve.pt/en/518/equipamento-patrimonio---faro---igreja-da-ordem-terceira-de-nossa-senhora-do-monte-do-carmo.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.visitalgarve.pt/en/518/equipamento-patrimonio---faro---igreja-da-ordem-terceira-de-nossa-senhora-do-monte-do-carmo.aspx</a></p>"}]}},{"type":"POI","id":"206195","city":"FAO","country":"PT","region":"EUR","filters":[{"code":"MUST_SEE","label":"Must See"}],"topic":"countryside - exploring","publicationDate":"2021-06-25","isHidden":false,"isPartner":false,"isCrush":false,"content":{"title":"Lagos and Ponta da Piedade, the sweetness of living","introduction":{"small":"In the west of the Algarve, the city of Lagos, perched on a hill alongside the sea, offers evidence of the past, as well as natural wonders."},"mainPicture":{"url":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/news/FAO/lagos-et-ponta-da-piedade-la-douceur-de-vivre/FAO-lagos-et-ponta-da-piedade-la-douceur-de-vivre-1_1-1024x1024.jpg","accessibilityDescription":"Lagos and Ponta da Piedade, the sweetness of living"},"paragraphs":[{"text":"<p>A famous port since Antiquity, Lagos has been the scene of productive multicultural encounters, but the signs of this past are more secret than in the east of the region.
