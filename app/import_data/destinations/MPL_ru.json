Impeccable service truly does credit to the establishment's five stars. Breakfasts are prepared exclusively with products from organic farms and the Domaine's own vegetable garden. The surrounding trees, lush meadows, and horses roaming nearby offer a bucolic setting, offset by the luxurious azure-blue pool, plunging us into a sublime reverie. The Domaine de Biar is not so much a hotel as an experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Domaine de Biar</strong><br />\nChemin de Biar<br />\n34880 Lavérune</p>\n<p>+33 (0)4 67 65 70 06</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://domainedebiar.com/biar/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://domainedebiar.com/biar/en/</a></p>\n<p>Rooms: from 228 EUR</p>","moreInfo":[{"geoCoordinates":{"longitude":"3°48'51.213\"E","latitude":"43°35'45.496\"N"}}]}]}}],"articlesSort":{"ALL":["206804","199348","199344","199346","199350","156642","108275","107219","2913","2975","2940","3030","2956","2983","2923","4434","2933","3039","3028","3010","2988","3019","3026","3003"],"RECENT_NEWS":[],"UNCATEGORIZED":[],"activity":["108275","107219","2913","2975","2940","2956","2983","2923","2933","2988"],"Gastronomy":["199344","199350","156642","3030","4434","3039","3028"],"Hotel":["206804","199348","199346","3010","3019","3026","3003"]},"desktopSettings":{"initialNumber":5,"paginationNumber":10},"mobileSettings":{"initialNumber":15,"paginationNumber":20},"priceCurrency":{"code":"EUR","symbol":"&euro;"},"practicalInfos":{"origin":{"code":"MPL","label":"Монпелье","canonicalName":"monpelie"},"destination":{"code":"PAR","label":"Париж"},"effectiveFlightDuration":"PT1H20M","spokenLanguages":[{"code":"fr","language":"French"}],"time":{"jetLag":"+00:00","timeZone":"GMT+01:00"},"weather":{"pictogramLabel":"белые облака","temperature":[{"value":10,"unit":"CELSIUS"}],"pictogramCode":"white_cloud","pictogramUrlSvg":"","pictogramUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/media/566B2B45-FCBA-4F71-9BB65C78B6384C33","description":""},"currency":{"data":{"code":"EUR","label":"Евро","rate":1,"symbol":"&#8364;"}},"travelGuide":{"isTravelGuideAvailable":false}}}
