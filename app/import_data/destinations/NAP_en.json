Gaze ahead, sit back and relax, carried by the invigorating flow of one of the largest cities in the Mediterranean.</p>\n<p>The capital of Campania is home to three million people who highly cherish their traditions, while remaining open to rest of the world. Cultural life is intense and feeds the rich past of the castles, palaces, villas, churches, monasteries and museums who compete for this holiday destination of the ancient Romans. The vast historic centre, designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995, boasts unrivalled archaeological treasures.</p>\n<p>Far from falling asleep on its prestigious achievements, the city plays the card of progress and innovation: there Apple opened its first school for computer programmers, the network of shared electric cars continues to grow and the new metro system, at the cutting edge of technology, has 16 stations designed as works of art, a project at the forefront of urban architecture.</p>\n<p>The Neapolitan good life is distinguished by its world-renowned cuisine. Famous for its pizza, of course, nearly as highly regarded as a national monument, gives pride of place to local products: vegetables are grown in abundance and tomatoes, another landmark of the region, are among the best in Italy. The nearby sea inspires soups and <em>fritto misti</em> (fried seafood and small fish). To experience another pride of the regional gastronomy, taste the unmatchable <em>mozzarella di buffalo </em>of Campania, nicknamed <em>oro bianco</em> (white gold). That says it all!</p>\n<p>A few dozen kilometres from the centre, while nature reclaims its rights on the remarkable site of Pompeii, the fumaroles of Vesuvius are a reminder that the giant is still dormant, but that doesn't undermine the constant good humour of the Neapolitans.</p>\n<p>Nestled in the hollow of its dazzling gulf, the radiant city will offer you the most pleasant of stays.
