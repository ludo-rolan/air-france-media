It has to be said that, thanks to the proximity of the ocean, the protection ensured by the Serra de Monchique against the cold airstreams from the north, and the south-facing exposure, the region's climate is perfect for wine-growing. Today, over twenty producers operate between Lagos and Tavira. Planted in an astonishing variety of soils, their vines produce a wide range of grape varieties, such as Arinto, Fernão Pires, Malvasia Fina, Chardonnay and Sauvignon for the whites, Alicante Bouschet, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Trincadeira, Petit Verdot and Touriga Nacional for the reds.</p>\n<p>Visit these <em>quintas</em> (“farms”), such as Quinta do Outeiro, near the town of Silves, to explore the vines and savour the wines of the Algarve. Thanks, in particular, to manual harvesting in 20-kilo containers and eight months' ageing in French casks, Joaquim Lopes has turned his estate into an indisputable leading name that supplies a great many restaurants in the surrounding area.</p>\n<p>When your visit is over, travel on five kilometres to Quinta da Vinha. This farm is distinctive for growing a typical old grape variety, the Negra Mole. This grape yields a light red wine, verging on rosé, which is a perfect match for fish and seafood. Follow your guide through the cellar and vineyard to discover the production process, step by step. Afterwards, you can take a break and enjoy some delicious <em>petiscos</em> (local tapas).</p>\n<p>A few kilometres further on, the Quinta dos Sentidos welcomes you with a guided tour of its vines, production tools and flower garden. When it comes to tasting - in moderation, of course - this is done a little differently here: in addition to wine, you will taste verjuice, the acidic juice that comes from unripe grapes. And even those who are not into oenology will find something to enjoy here. The estate makes an excellent olive oil, one or more bottles of which you can take home in your luggage.

And yet, you only need step outside the hotel's surrounding wall to follow the narrow streets that wind across the hill, descend on foot to the marina or push on further towards the beaches, or even Ponta da Piedade. “We are in an urban oasis, very quiet thanks to the garden,” enthuses Véronique, the owner, who originates from France.</p>\n<p>This mini resort offers three types of accommodation: 22 bedrooms inside “Jogo da Bola”, the large contemporary, minimalist building that reinterprets the traditional architecture of the Algarve; five bedrooms inside “Casa Mãe”, the splendid historic building that gives the hotel its name; and lastly the “Cabañas”, three villas especially for families or groups of friends, with patio and private pool.</p>\n<p>The hotel takes a responsible approach by focusing entirely on proximity: the produce used in the two restaurants comes from the garden, from a farm a few kilometres away or from carefully selected local producers, and the craftsmanship of the Algarve is evident in the spa and in the décor, as in the carefully-sourced skin treatments and the Olhão terracotta (a terracotta typical of the region). According to the owner, staying at Casa Mãe is more than being in a hotel, it is “being part of a virtuous circle”.</p>\n<p><strong>Casa Mãe<br />\n</strong>Rua do Jogo da Bola 41<br />\n8600-712 Lagos</p>\n<p>Tel : +351 968 369 732</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://casa-mae.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://casa-mae.com</a></p>\n<p>Rooms: from 170 EUR</p>","moreInfo":[{"geoCoordinates":{"longitude":"8°40'31.094\"W","latitude":"37°6'10.478\"N"}}]}]}},{"type":"POI","id":"206258","city":"FAO","country":"PT","region":"EUR","filters":[{"code":"ACCOMODATION","label":"Accommodation"}],"topic":"boutique hotel - eco-friendly","publicationDate":"2021-06-25","isHidden":false,"isPartner":false,"isCrush":false,"content":{"title":"Casa Modesta, view of Ria Formosa","introduction":{"small":"In the countryside inland of Olhão, about fifteen kilometres from Faro, the Fernandes family welcomes you to Casa Modesta, an ecological boutique hotel overlooking the natural park."},"mainPicture":{"url":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/news/FAO/casa-modesta-vue-sur-ria-formosa/FAO-casa-modesta-vue-sur-ria-formosa-1_1-1024x1024.jpg","accessibilityDescription":"Casa Modesta, view of Ria Formosa"},"paragraphs":[{"text":"<p>The house is indicative of the local culture. Built in the 1940s by the great-grandparents, it has been completely remodelled to turn it into a little architectural gem, still in keeping with the architectural features characteristic of the region, which lives mainly by fishing: cube-shaped, white, with a rooftop for drying fish and looking out over the ocean.</p>\n<p>Nearly 70 years on, the entire family helped transform the house into Casa Modesta, a responsible boutique hotel that cares for the environment. Carols, the son, managed the project, while Vânia, his architect sister, threw herself into renovating the place. Their parents, who are farmers, take care of the kitchen and even their grandmother sometimes helps make dinner for the guests.</p>\n<p>The family takes an ecological approach to every detail of daily life. “The swimming pool water is purified for watering the organic garden we are cultivating, the solar panels warm the water, and all the materials used for the renovation are sustainable and local,” explains Carlos. Each of the nine minimalist bedrooms, some of which can inter-communicate to make things easier for families, has a private terrace with a view over the Ria Formosa Natural Park. In the garden, there is even a swing suspended from a branch of a hundred-year-old carob tree. There is no doubt about it, Casa Modesta has retained all its authenticity.</p>\n<p><strong>Casa Modesta<br />\n</strong>Quatrim do Sul<br />\n8700-128 Olhão</p>\n<p>Tel : +351 964 738 824</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.casamodesta.pt/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.casamodesta.pt/en/</a></p>\n<p>Rooms: from 120 EUR</p>","moreInfo":[{"geoCoordinates":{"longitude":"7°47'7.714\"W","latitude":"37°2'31.085\"N"}}]}]}}],"articlesSort":{"ALL":["206217","206290","206224","206208","206205","206199","206299","206266","206221","206195","206276","206281","206274","206188","206191","206285","206213","206295","206264","206258"],"RECENT_NEWS":[],"UNCATEGORIZED":["206299"],"activity":["206217","206224","206208","206205","206199","206221","206195","206188","206191","206213"],"Gastronomy":["206290","206281","206285","206295"],"Hotel":["206266","206276","206274","206264","206258"]},"desktopSettings":{"initialNumber":5,"paginationNumber":10},"mobileSettings":{"initialNumber":15,"paginationNumber":20},"priceCurrency":{"code":"EUR","symbol":"&euro;"},"practicalInfos":{"origin":{"code":"FAO","label":"ファロ","canonicalName":"faro"},"destination":{"code":"PAR","label":"パリ"},"effectiveFlightDuration":"PT2H40M","spokenLanguages":[{"code":"pt","language":"ポルトガル語"}],"time":{"jetLag":"-01:00","timeZone":"GMT+00:00"},"weather":{"pictogramLabel":"晴れ","temperature":[{"value":16,"unit":"CELSIUS"}],"pictogramCode":"sunny","pictogramUrlSvg":"","pictogramUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/media/09421D21-1365-4662-950D2E658231FA20","description":""},"currency":{"data":{"code":"EUR","label":"ユーロ","rate":1,"symbol":"&#8364;"}},"travelGuide":{"isTravelGuideAvailable":false}}}
