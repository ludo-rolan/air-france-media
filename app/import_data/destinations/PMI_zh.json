Partitioned by Chopin, the island touches on the sublime.</em></p>\n<p>Whether you're thinking of «Maiorica» in Latin, «Mayurqa» in Arabic, or «Mallorca» in Catalan, the island remains the “great island” – literally – of the Balearic Islands. The island found its French spelling in 1842 when George Sand published her autobiographical travel novel <em>A winter in Mallorca (Un Hiver à Majorque)</em>, about her trip with Frederic Chopin (1838-1839). The novel and its tales of stunning beauty turned George Sand into the island's greatest ambassador. Chopin, too, was taken by the poetry of the luxurious Valldemossa Monastery and its surroundings, he composed his <em>Preludes</em> here.<br />\nWhether you are an artist or a tourist, the many facets of the island of Mallorca will enchant your imagination. On one side you may navigate its turquoise coves, bays hidden between cliffs, or beaches of fine sand lined with pines. On the other, you'll find the stunning pastoral scenery of the rugged green Serra de Tramuntana, with vineyards at its feet. The entire island breathes history thanks to the Roman ruins of the ancient town of Pollentia, the various monasteries or chartreuses which you will discover during your walks. There is the city of Palma, of course, its bay, port, Catalan Gothic cathedral, Alcazar - the Almudaina – which has become a proud hidalgo palace. Over a few decades, Palma has transformed itself into a modern and cosmopolitan capital, an alliance of \"poetry and light\" according to Joan Miró, the Catalan artist whose characteristic style you will identify in the streets of the old town. Palma knows how to cultivate the arts, and multi-coloured masterpieces that you will also admire in its galleries and museums.</p>","paragraph":[{"title":"","text":""}],"slideShow":{"topic":"","title":"","pictures":[{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-PMI-2","imageAccessibility":"Palma de Mallorca 2"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-PMI-3","imageAccessibility":"Palma de Mallorca 3"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-PMI-4","imageAccessibility":"Palma de Mallorca 4"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-PMI-5","imageAccessibility":"Palma de Mallorca 5"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-PMI-6","imageAccessibility":"Palma de Mallorca 6"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-PMI-7","imageAccessibility":"Palma de Mallorca 7"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-PMI-8","imageAccessibility":"Palma de Mallorca 8"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-PMI-9","imageAccessibility":"Palma de Mallorca 9"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-PMI-10","imageAccessibility":"Palma de Mallorca 10"}]},"mainVideo":{"videoTitle":"","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"216161629","sizes":[{"height":"360","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/216161629.sd.mp4?s=3fbd9da327615571271b441ee1bfb310c2c02316&profile_id=164&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"720","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/216161629.hd.mp4?s=135204402896329232c11d4dfa1a53e27001e13f&profile_id=174&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"1080","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/216161629.hd.mp4?s=135204402896329232c11d4dfa1a53e27001e13f&profile_id=119&oauth2_token_id=911185232"}],"videoSource":"VIMEO","videoTopic":"","videoAccessibility":""},"otherVideos":[{"videoTitle":"Discover Palma de Mallorca and surroundings","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"hrdNn6rlEOg","sizes":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hrdNn6rlEOg?loop=0&rel=0"}],"videoSource":"YOUTUBE","videoTopic":"Insight video","videoAccessibility":"","videoImageUrl":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/PMI/video/PMI-video-1_1-1024x1024.jpg"}],"map":{"introduction":"","mapTitle":"Our selection of must-see places in Palma de Mallorca","mapId":"https://api.getwemap.com/customers/tbaf/points?destination=PMI&language=en&market=FR","mapUrl":"https://objects.airfrance.com/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/PMI/map/PMI-map.jpeg","mapTopic":"Discovery map","mapSource":"0","mapAccessibility":""},"seoData":{"seoTitle":"Travel Guide Palma de Mallorca - Plan your trip to Palma de Mallorca with Air France Travel Guide","seoDescription":"Stay in Palma de Mallorca : what to visit to Palma de Mallorca , where to stay, which restaurant to go?
