            "intro": "<p><em>A thriving centre for art, design, and music, the German capital will keep surprising you with its madness and beauty.</em></p>\n<p>Germany's capital and largest city, Berlin has 3.7 million inhabitants. From 1961 to 1989, the city was divided in two by the Berlin Wall, and it was not until 1990 that it again became the nation's capital. From monuments, damaged walls, and Soviet-era buildings, remnants from the past surround you . Despite its ever-present history, the city is one of the youngest in Europe, strongly looking towards the future. It's bustling day and night with partying, dancing, bicycling, open-air museums, and dance halls down at the waterfront. For artists and creators, Berlin now is like the New York of the 1960s, a city where everything is possible… and a little crazy.<br />\nBerlin is full of history, and its monuments remind you of it on every street corner. The Reichstag, Museum Island, and the Holocaust Memorial are essential stops during your journey in the city. Take advantage of your stay to discover an abandoned airport transformed into family park, climb to the top of the TV tower that dominates the city, find out about the remains of the Wall, decorated by artists from around the world, sail on the Spree river or visit an old train station transformed into a museum of contemporary art.<br />\nYou can also grab a takeaway <em>currywurst</em>, Berlin's favourite sausage, test the Korean barbecue in one of the most cosmopolitan addresses in the city, or book a table at Cookies Cream, the vegetarian restaurant known around the world. In Berlin, you can sleep in a former embassy overlooking the zoo, in a slightly quirky arty hotel with basketball hoops in the lobby, or rent a stylish apartment in the heart of the city. Here, everything is different, ecstatically underground and offbeat, yet always so vibrant.</p>",

With Coda, it remains true to that fact, as this atypical restaurant is entirely devoted to dessert serving. In the kitchen, pastry chef René Frank created a menu of delicacies, sometimes up to seven courses. The house mixologist will pair each dish with creation cocktails. Forget what you think you know about desserts, as eating at Coda Dessert Dining is neither sickly-sweet nor bad for the health, all desserts being sugar-free, and usually quite low in calories. The procession of flavours organized by René Frank is based on the original taste of fruits and vegetables. For instance, the eggplant-based dessert adds pecan nut, apple and balsamic vinegar, and the rhubarb one is mixed with tofu and tarragon. This melting pot is so engaging that Coda was even awarded a Michelin star for its innovative cuisine and exceptional <em>savoir-faire</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Coda Dessert Dining</strong><br />\nFriedelstraße 47<br />\n12047 Berlin</p>\n<p>+49 (0)30 914 963 96</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://coda-berlin.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">coda-berlin.com/en/</a></p>\n<p>Menu: from 54 EUR</p>",

In a building made of former shipping containers, BRLO Brwhouse (the first word means Berlin in old Slavic dialect) unveils a selection of about twenty crafted beers, to be tried for pre-dinner on the large terrace that gives on the Gleisdreieck Park. A few deck chairs add to the family setting, with a sandpit installed for young patrons. For dinner time, the restaurant boasts a menu that changes every month. Local products are being used, like cauliflower, kohlrabi, broccoli and radish. You can compose your dish as you please: vegetables are the main attraction, but you can also choose mashed potatoes, tabbouleh, meat or fish.

Since January 1990, 118 artists from 21 different countries have come and decorated it by brush and spray can, often with messages about the division and reunification of Germany, but more often on the themes of freedom and love. Unfortunately, the drawings degrade over time and the wall is crumbling. Near the Ostbahn of train station, 40 drawings were renovated in 2009 to celebrate the 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the fall of the wall.

You can choose beef, octopus, classic pork <em>bulgogi</em>, vegetables or 'The Fantastic Entrecote', in ultra-thin slices.

The cruise takes you to the Saint-Nicolas district, the oldest part of the city, where you will see modern architecture like the Haus der Kulturen der Welt and Norman Foster's dome on the renovated Reichstag.
