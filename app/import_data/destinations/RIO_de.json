Formerly the territory of the indigenous Tamoio people, the island, discovered by the French in the mid-16<sup>th</sup> century, was finally taken over by the Portuguese, who divided it into two parcels. Charming for its small colonial houses and buildings, the island and its 3,000 inhabitants enjoy a car-free environment the only way to get around is on foot or by horse or bike.</p>\n<p>When doing so, you will discover that the place is home to towering palms and twenty rare species of baobabs, found only in Brazil. The island's beautiful beaches are great places to take in a sunset, or to dine in small fresh-fish restaurants, where you can dance samba all night long.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ilhadepaqueta.com.br/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.ilhadepaqueta.com.br</a></p>","moreInfo":[{"geoCoordinates":{"longitude":"43°6'29.073\"W","latitude":"22°45'57.896\"S"}}]}]}},{"type":"POI","id":"16804","city":"RIO","country":"BR","region":"AME","filters":[{"code":"MUST_SEE","label":"Must See"},{"code":"SPORTS_AND_WELL_BEING","label":"Sports and Well-being"}],"topic":"sports and well-being","publicationDate":"2016-02-15","isHidden":false,"isPartner":false,"isCrush":false,"content":{"title":"Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon: one of the world's most beautiful","introduction":{"small":"Another postcard landscape, not as well known, dedicated to sport and partying."},"mainPicture":{"url":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/news/RIO/lagoa-rodrigo-de-freitas-le-plus-beau-des-lagons/RIO-lagoa-rodrigo-de-freitas-le-plus-beau-des-lagons-1_1-1024x1024.jpg","accessibilityDescription":"Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon: one of the world's most beautiful"},"paragraphs":[{"text":"<p>Located in the southern zone of Rio, surrounded by mountains, modern buildings and villas, and tropical forests and beaches, Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon is another Rio jewel.</p>\n<p>A blue lagoon fed by salt water, it is home to many wealthy Cariocas and multiple sporting activities.
