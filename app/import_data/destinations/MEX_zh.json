A megalopolis with almost 9 million inhabitants in the city proper, this is a place that never sleeps.</em></p>\n<p>With its green parks, colonial palaces, and world-class museums, Mexico offers endless options for urban adventurers, art lovers, and those who are simply curious about the world. Mexico City was founded by Spanish conquistadors in 1525 on the ruins of the ancient Aztec city of Tenochtitlan. With this rich and eventful history, it is an ideal destination for anyone wishing to discover the history of the country. Its city centre, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is an enjoyable journey through buildings steeped in history, like El Zócalo (otherwise known as ‘Plaza de la Constitución'), the largest square in the city. Bordered on one side by the National Palace, which houses the offices of the Mexican President, the Treasury, and the National Archives, and on the other by the Metropolitan Cathedral (its full name: Catedral Metropolitana de la Asunción de María Catedral Metropolitana de México), a vestige of the colonial era, this is where the country's main events take place. Get lost in the city, stroll through Chapultepec Park, as do all families on Sunday, and look up to see the palm trees and all the riches of the city.<br />\nFinally, Mexico City is enchanting for artists, who come here to visit the home of the famous painter Frida Kahlo or to visit the museum of modern art. Glide through the canals of Xochimilco aboard a trajinera, a flowery and colourful boat on which you can eat tortillas, tacos, enchiladas, quesadillas, and other delicacies.<br />\nBut the discovery of the city would not be complete without a visit to the famous Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, which annually welcomes millions of pilgrims who come to pray where the Virgin Mary was said to have appeared to a shepherd in the 16th century.</p>","paragraph":[{"title":"","text":""}],"slideShow":{"topic":"","title":"","pictures":[{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MEX-2","imageAccessibility":"Mexico City 2"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MEX-3","imageAccessibility":"Mexico City 3"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MEX-4","imageAccessibility":"Mexico City 4"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MEX-5","imageAccessibility":"Mexico City 5"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MEX-6","imageAccessibility":"Mexico City 6"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MEX-7","imageAccessibility":"Mexico City 7"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MEX-8","imageAccessibility":"Mexico City 8"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MEX-9","imageAccessibility":"Mexico City 9"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-MEX-10","imageAccessibility":"Mexico City 10"}]},"mainVideo":{"videoTitle":"","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"152503143","sizes":[{"height":"360","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/152503143.sd.mp4?s=b0757a3c1af9a82fa537158fc73d39cc2357d3b1&profile_id=112&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"720","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/152503143.hd.mp4?s=4b31b009815e578d4b164095df7db8ae67610e8a&profile_id=113&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"1080","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/152503143.hd.mp4?s=4b31b009815e578d4b164095df7db8ae67610e8a&profile_id=119&oauth2_token_id=911185232"}],"videoSource":"VIMEO","videoTopic":"","videoAccessibility":""},"otherVideos":[{"videoTitle":"Discover Mexico City and surroundings","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"DrZX6k5E8ao","sizes":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DrZX6k5E8ao?loop=0&rel=0"}],"videoSource":"YOUTUBE","videoTopic":"Insight video","videoAccessibility":"","videoImageUrl":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/MEX/video/MEX-video-1_1-1024x1024.jpg"}],"map":{"introduction":"","mapTitle":"Our selection of must-see places in and around Mexico city","mapId":"https://api.getwemap.com/customers/tbaf/points?destination=MEX&language=en&market=FR","mapUrl":"https://objects.airfrance.com/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/MEX/map/MEX-map.jpeg","mapTopic":"Discovery map","mapSource":"0","mapAccessibility":""},"seoData":{"seoTitle":"Travel Guide Mexico City  - Plan your trip to Mexico City with Air France Travel Guide","seoDescription":"Stay in Mexico City: what to visit to Mexico City, where to stay, which restaurant to go?

It does not take long to fall for its colourful streets and markets, the plethora of colonial-era monuments and, of course, its unique archaeological treasures. It proves to be the perfect place for those who simply like to take their time and enjoy a cultural and gourmet break. So, take advantage of the mild temperatures between November and January to get to know this mythical city.</p>\n<p>As you wander around the streets of Oaxaca, and especially down the famous pedestrianised Calle Alcalá, do not miss the Santo Domingo Cultural Centre. Santo Domingo de Guzmán church is part of this huge architectural complex. Flanked by two 35 metre high towers, each crowned with a cupola made of blue and white ceramic tiles, it is a symbol of its own importance. When you step through the door, you are struck by the contrast between the simple facade outside and the splendid, exuberant Mexican Baroque style inside. You will not manage to count them all, but almost 60,000 pieces of gold leaf were used inside the church! Then, look up at the ceiling in the nave to see 36 paintings representing scenes from the Old Testament. This building, constructed in the 16<sup>th</sup> century, has had a glorious past; for a time, it was the most imposing religious complex in Mexico, comprising a Dominican convent, vast gardens and umpteen patios. Paying due respect to its past grandeur, an extensive renovation campaign got underway back in 1993.</p>\n<p>Today, you can also visit the Francisco de Burgoa library with works dating from the 15<sup>th</sup> to 20<sup>th</sup> centuries. Do not forget to take a walk in the Ethnobotanical Garden: the collection of Mexican plants and cacti is simply wonderful. Finally, put time aside to visit the Museum of Oaxacan Cultures. This is where Zapotec treasures discovered in the archaeological sites of Monte Albán are displayed, the highlight being the superb Mixtec stash from Tomb 7, discovered in 1932. It provides a fascinating journey to the very heart of pre-Hispanic civilisations.</p>\n<p><strong>Santo Domingo Cultural Centre<br />\n</strong>Macedonio Alcalá s/n<br />\n68000 Oaxaca de Juárez<br />\nMexico<br />\n+52 (951) 516 9741<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/Centro-Cultural-Santo-Domingo-177190954302/about/?ref=page_internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/pg/Centro-Cultural-Santo-Domingo-177190954302/about/?ref=page_internal</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>","picture":{"url":"https://img.static-af.com/images/media/7D3FB283-CEE4-40D2-90D48EB202934341/"}},{"text":"<p><strong>A taste for celebration</strong><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>You stroll along cobbled streets, admire trees in full bloom, see colourful buildings with thick walls.

Here, the locals love to put on a show to express their happiness and pride when celebrating an important family event, such as a wedding or christening.</p>\n<p>If you are staying in Oaxaca over the Christmas period, something festive will be going on almost every day. The <em>oaxaqueños</em> share the joy of Advent by decorating the streets and meeting up in the evening in the city centre decked out with Christmas lights. As the children are on holiday at this time of year, there is even more of a party atmosphere.</p>\n<p>After these lively nights out on the town, you come back to the peaceful surroundings of your hotel, the Casa Oaxaca, located a stone's throw from the Zócalo. This boutique hotel, with just seven rooms, occupies a beautiful 18<sup>th</sup>-century colonial residence which has been completely renovated and decorated to create an uncluttered, contemporary feel. You will love the contrast of vibrant colours, the carefully selected works by local artists and the central patio, a typical feature of these houses, profusely decorated with pots of cacti cleverly placed here and there. It is perfect for reading a book, having breakfast or just relaxing, unless, of course, you prefer one of the hammocks up on the roof terrace.

Legend has it that the best hot chocolate in the world is right here in Oaxaca. It is true that Mexico is the historic birthplace of cocoa. The Aztecs knew how to enjoy the tasty qualities of the famous bean with its slight hint of bitterness, long before the arrival of the Europeans led by Hernán Cortés. Most often, it is cultivated in Chiapas and then brought to Oaxaca for roasting. Calling chocoholics of all ages… head to Calle Mina where you will find Mayordomo, La Soledad and Guelaguetza chocolate shops. Here, chocolate is everywhere in all its forms: as chips, it melts delicately in your mouth; as squares, you bite into it with a big crunch; as powder, it is mixed with boiling water or milk for a marvellous chocolatey drink. Our advice is to ask for almonds, vanilla or even cinnamon to be added to your preparation, in place of the original chilli pepper. In that way, you walk out with your own customised chocolate! You can also opt for artisan chocolate made in one of the many workshops, such as Fantasía en Chocolate in Calle Xicoténcatl.</p>\n<p>For a fitting end to your gourmet break, make your way to Benito Juárez market. Once there, head to La Toñita. A frothy hot chocolate arrives just the way you like it, giving off a delicious aroma. Quiet please, we are savouring the moment… Do you want to recreate the same ‘moustache' effect when you get back home? Then consider buying a <em>molinillo, </em>a wooden utensil that whisks up that famous frothy creaminess. If you have a bit of time to spare, wander up and down the aisles of the market; you will find local crafts and also some very tasty specialities, such as <em>quesillo</em> (string cheese) and <em>tasajo</em> (dried beef).
