For instance, you can still sometimes hear a couple of country music tunes at the Anderson Fair Retail Restaurant in Montrose or at the McGonigel's Mucky Duck, an Irish pub on Norfolk Street.</p>\n<p>The Indie Rock scene is well-represented at Fitzgerald's and Dan Electro's Guitar Bar in The Heights.
