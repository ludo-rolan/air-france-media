Shades of blue contrast with the golden sand of its six beaches, the reputation of which having gone international. All year long now, skillful surfers look for the right wave, board under the arm, from the famous Basque coast.</p>\n<p>\"When you hesitate between two beaches,\" famous French playwright Sacha Guitry used to take great pleasure in saying, \"one of them is always Biarritz<em>.</em>\" The world-famous Grande Plage (Great Beach) beach attracts surfers and sun worshippers from around the world.</p>\n<p>Golfers flock to the region for its sublime courses, like the superb Chiberta that runs along the coast. Nestled between sea and mountain, Biarritz offers views of the first slopes of the Pyrenees, dotted with villages of picturesque houses with red shutters. The unique landscape provides a perfect excuse to set off and explore hills and villages, on foot, by bike or on a \"<em>pottok</em>\" - the small horse of the Basque region. Local traditions and cultures are part of the charm of this \"<em>pays</em>\" that still speaks Basque, the lilting language that you will hear in the grandstand at rugby matches or pelota games. In the newly renovated Les Halles de Biarritz, foodies share tapas, <em>pintxos</em> and other delectable goodies, such as the famous Gateau Basque cake. A few kilometres away, you may visit Guéthary, an old whale fishing harbour and perfect spot to sip a cocktail while taking in the sunset. The nightlife continues at the Spanish border, in Hondarribia and San Sebastián, linked together by the famous coast path. Their exceptional landscapes and atmosphere make for a genuine change of scenery.</p>","paragraph":[{"title":"","text":""}],"slideShow":{"topic":"","title":"","pictures":[{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-BIQ-2","imageAccessibility":"Biarritz 2"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-BIQ-3","imageAccessibility":"Biarritz 3"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-BIQ-4","imageAccessibility":"Biarritz 4"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-BIQ-5","imageAccessibility":"Biarritz 5"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-BIQ-6","imageAccessibility":"Biarritz 6"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-BIQ-7","imageAccessibility":"Biarritz 7"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-BIQ-8","imageAccessibility":"Biarritz 8"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-BIQ-9","imageAccessibility":"Biarritz 9"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-BIQ-10","imageAccessibility":"Biarritz 10"}]},"mainVideo":{"videoTitle":"","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"152547717","sizes":[{"height":"360","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/152547717.sd.mp4?s=485470a602da532bd391adbdd2fa62f497d6f7d5&profile_id=112&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"720","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/152547717.hd.mp4?s=5823099eb5092960b06719c5bbcde700146c65d5&profile_id=113&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"1080","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/152547717.hd.mp4?s=5823099eb5092960b06719c5bbcde700146c65d5&profile_id=119&oauth2_token_id=911185232"}],"videoSource":"VIMEO","videoTopic":"","videoAccessibility":""},"otherVideos":[{"videoTitle":"Discover Biarritz-bayonne and surroundings","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"TR-MPyWYH3U","sizes":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TR-MPyWYH3U?loop=0&rel=0"}],"videoSource":"YOUTUBE","videoTopic":"Insight video","videoAccessibility":"","videoImageUrl":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/BIQ/video/BIQ-video-1_1-1024x1024.jpg"}],"map":{"introduction":"","mapTitle":"Our selection of must-see places in and around Biarritz","mapId":"https://api.getwemap.com/customers/tbaf/points?destination=BIQ&language=en&market=FR","mapUrl":"https://objects.airfrance.com/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/BIQ/map/BIQ-map.jpeg","mapTopic":"Discovery map","mapSource":"0","mapAccessibility":""},"seoData":{"seoTitle":"Biarritz, the ocean in full -
