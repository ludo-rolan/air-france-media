Birthplace of the \"Chicago Blues\" and a world capital of jazz, the city is full of legendary clubs such as the Green Mill, where Al Capone hung out, which draws as many tourists as the city's many historical monuments, and where the presence of Louis Armstrong, who played here early on in his career, still permeates the atmosphere. Besides its strong musical identity, Chicago shines worldwide for its majestic architecture. In The Loop, the business district and cultural centre, red brick skyscrapers jostle for attention alongside 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> century masterpieces by Frank Lloyd Wright, Frank Gehry and Renzo Piano. These and other architectural treasures are best viewed by taking the ‘L' rapid transit system, a Chicago landmark. Equally magnificent, and very popular among tourists, is the famous boat cruise along the Chicago River, which offers spectacular panoramas of the city. A true cultural getaway with 40 museums, including the world renowned Art Institute of Chicago, the sweet life that reigns in this, the third largest city in the United States, can also be enjoyed strolling through one of its incredible parks, such as Millennium Park, a veritable open-air art gallery. The warm water of Lake Michigan is a big summertime draw, and a string of sandy beaches stretching as far as the eye can see – 33 in the city centre alone – attracts huge crowds.</p>","paragraph":[{"title":"","text":""}],"slideShow":{"topic":"","title":"","pictures":[{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-CHI-2","imageAccessibility":"Chicago 2"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-CHI-3","imageAccessibility":"Chicago 3"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-CHI-4","imageAccessibility":"Chicago 4"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-CHI-5","imageAccessibility":"Chicago 5"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-CHI-6","imageAccessibility":"Chicago 6"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-CHI-7","imageAccessibility":"Chicago 7"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-CHI-8","imageAccessibility":"Chicago 8"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-CHI-9","imageAccessibility":"Chicago 9"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-CHI-10","imageAccessibility":"Chicago 10"}]},"mainVideo":{"videoTitle":"","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"144353946","sizes":[{"height":"360","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/144353946.sd.mp4?s=64d77de992cbc5a1f4f7c65376a439ab69dac20e&profile_id=112&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"720","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/144353946.hd.mp4?s=e02c060a5291f13776a6ac30cfb42bb258171545&profile_id=113&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"1080","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/144353946.hd.mp4?s=e02c060a5291f13776a6ac30cfb42bb258171545&profile_id=119&oauth2_token_id=911185232"}],"videoSource":"VIMEO","videoTopic":"","videoAccessibility":""},"otherVideos":[{"videoTitle":"Discover Chicago and surroundings","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"N-vloVEiyVc","sizes":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N-vloVEiyVc?loop=0&rel=0"}],"videoSource":"YOUTUBE","videoTopic":"Insight video","videoAccessibility":"","videoImageUrl":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/CHI/video/CHI-video-1_1-1024x1024.jpg"}],"map":{"introduction":"","mapTitle":"Our selection of must-see places in and around Chicago","mapId":"https://api.getwemap.com/customers/tbaf/points?destination=CHI&language=en&market=FR","mapUrl":"https://objects.airfrance.com/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/CHI/map/CHI-map.jpeg","mapTopic":"Discovery map","mapSource":"0","mapAccessibility":""},"seoData":{"seoTitle":"Travel Guide Chicago  - Plan your trip to Chicago with Air France Travel Guide","seoDescription":"Stay in Chicago: what to visit to Chicago, where to stay, which restaurant to go?
