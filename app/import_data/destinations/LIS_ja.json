There is no designer furniture, nor trendy decorative elements it is as if time has stood still. If you have the opportunity, book Room Four: its large corner balcony has the best view. In the morning, enjoy the hearty breakfast served on the terrace. After that, all that is left to do is hop in one of the famous yellow trams on Line 28 to head off and explore the city - the closest stop is no more than a stone's throw from the hotel.</p>\n<p><strong>Albergaria Senhora do Monte</strong><br />\nCalçada do Monte 39<br />\n1170-250 Lisboa</p>\n<p>+351 21 886 6002</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hotelsenhoradomonte.com/index.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.hotelsenhoradomonte.com/index.php</a></p>\n<p>Rooms: from 90 EUR</p>","moreInfo":[{"geoCoordinates":{"longitude":"9°7'56.322\"W","latitude":"38°43'7.29\"N"}}]}]}},{"type":"POI","id":"3119","city":"LIS","country":"PT","region":"EUR","filters":[{"code":"ARTS_AND_CULTURE","label":"Art and Culture"}],"topic":"monument","publicationDate":"2016-02-13","isHidden":false,"isPartner":false,"isCrush":false,"content":{"title":"Castelo de São Jorge, royalty has to be earned","introduction":{"small":"Overlooking Lisbon, this splendid Moorish castle offers an incomparable panorama."},"mainPicture":{"url":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/news/LIS/castelo-de-sao-jorge-un-chateau-sur-la-ville/LIS-castelo-de-sao-jorge-un-chateau-sur-la-ville-1_1-1024x1024.jpg","accessibilityDescription":"Castelo de São Jorge, royalty has to be earned"},"paragraphs":[{"text":"<p>The castle entrance is in <a href=\"../../common/travel-guide/alfama-by-buggy-or-ape-calessino.htm\">the Alfama district</a>, but to enter the building and merit the view, one has to climb, climb, and climb some more.

Its impenetrable walls protected the medieval city. Built by the Visigoths in the 5<sup>th</sup> century, it was appropriated and expanded by the Moors in the 9<sup>th</sup> century. The ramparts are made of 12 gates and 18 towers that overlook the city. The 1775 earthquake caused extensive damage and it was not until 1938 that the dictator António Salazar undertook to rehabilitate the Castelo. Spend some time relaxing in its shady gardens, a charming haven of peace and coolness in this oh-so-bustling capital. And there, from the top of the fortified wall, enjoy a panorama like no other onto both the Tagus and Lisbon's centre.</p>\n<p><strong>Castelo de São Jorge</strong><br />\nRua de Santa Cruz do Castelo<br />\n1100-129 Lisboa</p>\n<p>+351 21 880 0620</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://castelodesaojorge.pt/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://castelodesaojorge.pt/en/</a></p>","moreInfo":[{"geoCoordinates":{"longitude":"9°8'0.514\"W","latitude":"38°42'50.073\"N"}}]}]}},{"type":"POI","id":"3254","city":"LIS","country":"PT","region":"EUR","filters":[{"code":"GOURMET_ADVENTURES","label":"Food and Drink"}],"topic":"pastry - pasteis de nata","publicationDate":"2016-01-15","isHidden":false,"isPartner":false,"isCrush":false,"content":{"title":"Pastéis de Belém, an institution","introduction":{"small":"Very close to the Jeronimos Monastery is the Pastéis de Belém, 'the' pastry shop of Lisbon."},"mainPicture":{"url":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/news/LIS/antiga-confeitaria-de-belem-une-institution/LIS-antiga-confeitaria-de-belem-une-institution-1_1-1024x1024.jpg","accessibilityDescription":"Pastéis de Belém, an institution"},"paragraphs":[{"text":"<p>Hundreds of <em>pastelarias</em> dot the streets of Lisbon, and locals stop in at all hours to sample the delicious pastries.
