Discover its rich past, taste its exciting present.</em></p>\n<p>Amsterdam is a city that reveals itself little by little. A city of contrasts as well: wealthy and poor, traditional and innovative, conservative and tolerant, of modest size with a global reputation. For those discovering it for the first time, Amsterdam is a labyrinth surrounded by canals bordered by stately old houses, a heritage of the Dutch Golden Age. By day, don't hesitate to lose yourself, on foot or by bicycle, in the maze of narrow streets. Stop to admire the tiny bridges straddling the canals, the shady terraces and the flowerboxes in the windows. It's here, far from the bustle of the centre, that you best feel the freshness, which seems to float over the city like the skies in Vermeer's landscapes. Here, quiet, tree-lined streets; further away, a tiny square where benches await a short break during your wanderings; nearby, a welcoming bar.<br />\nAmsterdam is a cosmopolitan city. It's to be expected: the variety of faces corresponds with the variety of restaurants. You will be seduced by a ‘brown café' on one corner and by a candlelit gourmet dinner on another. Besides the quintessential tulips, the markets overflow with vegetables and exotic fruits. If your appetite is for culture as well, the Van Gogh, NEMO, Rijksmuseum, and Stedelijk museums offer innumerable treasures. There are also trendy galleries representing young artists, chic hotels, antiques dealers, and much more to discover. In fact, a few days may not be enough time to see all there is to see… All the better for a return visit, because Amsterdam always has more to surprise you.</p>","paragraph":[{"title":"","text":""}],"slideShow":{"topic":"","title":"","pictures":[{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-AMS-2","imageAccessibility":"Amsterdam 2"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-AMS-3","imageAccessibility":"Amsterdam 3"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-AMS-4","imageAccessibility":"Amsterdam 4"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-AMS-5","imageAccessibility":"Amsterdam 5"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-AMS-6","imageAccessibility":"Amsterdam 6"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-AMS-7","imageAccessibility":"Amsterdam 7"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-AMS-8","imageAccessibility":"Amsterdam 8"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-AMS-9","imageAccessibility":"Amsterdam 9"},{"imageUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/meta/IDname/CITY-AMS-10","imageAccessibility":"Amsterdam 10"}]},"mainVideo":{"videoTitle":"","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"144349194","sizes":[{"height":"360","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/144349194.sd.mp4?s=72f74e2e99cae308e9e2bbd19aef0da4876f8352&profile_id=112&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"720","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/144349194.hd.mp4?s=bc0a4dc4fc201fbdaf618c2dc4c73fc5eccfe6f3&profile_id=113&oauth2_token_id=911185232"},{"height":"1080","url":"https://player.vimeo.com/external/144349194.hd.mp4?s=bc0a4dc4fc201fbdaf618c2dc4c73fc5eccfe6f3&profile_id=119&oauth2_token_id=911185232"}],"videoSource":"VIMEO","videoTopic":"","videoAccessibility":""},"otherVideos":[{"videoTitle":"Discover Amsterdam and surroundings","introduction":"","videoPlayerId":"9k9rqHO8vbY","sizes":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9k9rqHO8vbY?loop=0&rel=0"}],"videoSource":"YOUTUBE","videoTopic":"Insight video","videoAccessibility":"","videoImageUrl":"/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/AMS/video/AMS-video-1_1-1024x1024.jpg"}],"map":{"introduction":"","mapTitle":"Our selection of must-see places in and around Amsterdam","mapId":"https://api.getwemap.com/customers/tbaf/points?destination=AMS&language=en&market=FR","mapUrl":"https://objects.airfrance.com/FR/common/common/img/tbaf/destinations/AMS/map/AMS-map.jpeg","mapTopic":"Discovery map","mapSource":"0","mapAccessibility":""},"seoData":{"seoTitle":"City with a thousand faces – Amsterdam Travel Guide","seoDescription":"Canals and museums, terraces and tulips… Amsterdam, so familiar and yet so different, is the city of possibilities.

All around are red-brick facades and houses that are now owned by families whose children play happily in the grassy square. Do not forget to visit the clandestine church, hidden behind one of the dwellings.

Amsterdam has dedicated an entire museum to him, displaying some of his greatest works, such as <em>The Sower</em>,<em> The Potato Eaters </em>and<em> Almond Blossom</em>. In all, there are some 200 paintings on show. As the collection is organised chronologically into five periods, you can follow the personal and artistic journey of Van Gogh step by step through 500 drawings and 700 handwritten letters, including his avid correspondence with his brother Theo. The museum also exhibits paintings by his contemporaries, artists who had an influence on the painter in one way or another. So, keep your eyes open and discover paintings by Gauguin, Monet, Signac, Toulouse-Lautrec, Kees van Dongen.... Just stunning!
