Do not be fooled by appearances; you know that they are often misleading. You will be made very welcome here and your room will be a delight. If there are two of you, go for the standard size as it is excellent value for money.</p>\n<p>If you are a family, book a suite with a terrace, as the Parthenon, illuminated at night, enchants all. What a dream! All rooms are air-conditioned, which is pleasant in the sweltering city. The generous breakfast will keep you going until late lunch, which is never eaten before 2 p.m. If you are looking for good addresses, trust the receptionist, who is a fount of knowledge.</p>\n<p><strong>O&B Athens Boutique Hotel</strong><br />\nLeokoriou 7<br />\n105 54 Athens</p>\n<p>+30 210 331 2940</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.oandbhotel.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.oandbhotel.com</a></p>\n<p>Rooms: from 79 EUR</p>","moreInfo":[{"geoCoordinates":{"longitude":"23°43'18.909\"E","latitude":"37°58'39.31\"N"}}]}]}}],"articlesSort":{"ALL":["203421","203423","189315","189319","189317","155213","155209","155218","110489","110487","107329","107361","66883","1496","1711","1613","1440","1698","1734","1609","1659","1595","1524","1509","1482","1502","1514","1496","1489","1518","1471","1465","1623","1538","1720","1434","1685","1457","1601","1422","1678","1727","1560","1400","1630","1417","1704","1450","1406","1447","27566"],"RECENT_NEWS":[],"UNCATEGORIZED":["155218","1496"],"activity":["189315","110489","1440","1524","1482","1502","1514","1496","1489","1518","1471","1465","1434","1457","1422","1400","1417","1450","1406"],"Gastronomy":["203423","189319","189317","155213","107329","1711","1698","1734","1659","1509","1720","1685","1678","1727","1704","1447"],"Hotel":["203421","155209","110487","107361","66883","1613","1609","1595","1623","1538","1601","1560","1630","27566"]},"desktopSettings":{"initialNumber":5,"paginationNumber":10},"mobileSettings":{"initialNumber":15,"paginationNumber":20},"priceCurrency":{"code":"EUR","symbol":"&euro;"},"practicalInfos":{"origin":{"code":"ATH","label":"Atene","canonicalName":"atene"},"destination":{"code":"PAR","label":"Parigi"},"effectiveFlightDuration":"PT3H10M","spokenLanguages":[{"code":"el","language":"Greco"}],"time":{"jetLag":"+01:00","timeZone":"GMT+02:00"},"weather":{"pictogramLabel":"éclaircies","temperature":[{"value":11,"unit":"CELSIUS"}],"pictogramCode":"sunny_intervals","pictogramUrlSvg":"","pictogramUrl":"https://img.static-af.com/images/media/3646B953-6931-4D2F-97886B69A3CF7E33","description":""},"currency":{"data":{"code":"EUR","label":"Euro","rate":1,"symbol":"&#8364;"}},"travelGuide":{"isTravelGuideAvailable":false}}}
